Mr. Brown:
Thank you Thank you Thank you Great

Mr. Brown:
Thank you Thank you very much OK Thanks for filling these out and I promise thisll be quick At Diversity Today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations We believe that 99 of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance

Michael:
You know what This is a colorfreezone here Stanley I dont look at you as another race

Mr. Brown:
Uh see this is what Im talking about We dont have to pretend were colorblind

Mr. Brown:
Thats fighting ignorance with more ignorance

Michael:
With tolerance

Mr. Brown:
No With more ignorance

Michael:
Ignorance

Mr. Brown:
Right Exactly Uh instead we need to celebrate our diversity

Michael:
Lets celebrate

Mr. Brown:
Right OK

Michael:
Celebrate good times Come on Lets celebrate diversity Right

Mr. Brown:
Yes exactly Now heres what were going to do Ive noticed that

Dwight:
I have two White and Indian

Mr. Brown:
Actually Id prefer not to start that way Michael I would love to have your permission to run this session Can I have your permission

Michael:
Yes

Michael:
OK

Mr. Brown:
Thank you OK Now at the start of the session I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace Now what Im going to do is choose one and were going to act it out

Dwight:
OK can we steer away from gay people

Mr. Brown:
Um

Dwight:
Im sorry Its an orientation Its not a race Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadox

Dwight:
I figured it would save time

Michael:
OK Why dont we just defer to Mr

Mr. Brown:
Mr Brown

Michael:
Ah Oh right OK First test I will not call you that

Mr. Brown:
Well its my name Its not a test OK Um so looking through the cards Ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to Now how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine Very good OK

Michael:
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then I go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to Corporate Is it because Im white and Chris is black

Mr. Brown:
So were going to reenact this with a more positive outcome

Michael:
I will play the Chris Rock guy I would like to see someone else pull this off

Michael:
OK I will play guy listening

Mr. Brown:
Great Guy listening Ok anyone else remember

Kevin:
I remember

Mr. Brown:
Great Youre the Chris Rock guy and youre guy listening

Michael:
OK

Michael:
Kevin is a great guy Hes a great accountant He is not much of an entertainer

Kevin:
Basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people Every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess

Michael:
OK Im sorry Im sorry Hes ruin Hes butchering it Could you just let me As Chris Rock Every time Every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass Bleep I take care of my kid

Mr. Brown:
Wait a second

Mr. Brown:
Stop it

Mr. Brown:
Now this is a simple acronym HERO Uh at Diversity Today we believe it is very easy to be a HERO All you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindedness

Dwight:
Excuse me Im sorry but thats not all it takes to be a hero

Dwight:
A hero kills people people that wish him harm

Dwight:
A hero is parthuman and partsupernatural A hero is born out of a childhood trauma or out of a disaster that must be avenged

We all have a hero in our heart

Mr. Brown:
Okay Michael I just

Dwight:
Oh um Jan wants you to call her

Michael:
Were all going bowling

Dwight:
Michael

Michael:
Oh God Dwight come on

Dwight:
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing

Michael:
Theres no downsizing

Michael:
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight

Dwight:
Yeah so I dont have to worry

Michael:
Look look look I talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff And they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing okay

Michael:
But theres no downsizing so just dont

Michael:
Mmm mm mm Maybe

Michael:
It looks like theres gonna be downsizing And its part of my job but blah I hate it I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that uh I get no pleasure out of saying the words Youre fired as Donald Trump Youre foired Uh youre foired It just makes people sad and an office cant function that way No way as Donald Trump Youre foired  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be Youre hired and you can work here as long as you want But thats unrealistic so

Dwight:
Its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos Which puts me at a disadvantage because I bring my own water to work

Dwight:
I didnt do it What do you mean Oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance So what do you guys hear Whats the scuttlebutt

Michael:
Who is it Whos the birthday

Pam:
Um Actually we dont have any staff birthdays coming up

Pam:
How about green

Angela:
I think green is kind of whoreish

Pam:
This was tough I suggested we flip a coin But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her

Michael:
So I was thinking if you havent already got a cake um maybe going for one of those icecream cakes from BaskinRobbins Those are very good Very Delicious

Angela:
Merediths allergic to dairy so

Michael:
Shes not the only one thats going to be eating it right I think everybody likes icecream cake Its not uh its not just about her so

Dwight:
Hey so listen I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance Cause of the downsizing I think an alliance might be a good idea you know Help each other out

Dwight:
Good good Excellent OK Now we need to figure out whos vulnerable and whos protected

Jim:
At that moment I was so happy I mean everything Dwight does annoys me

Dwight:
Did you get your tickets

Jim:
To what

Dwight:
The gun show Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep

Jim:
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that could get me arrested And then here he comes and he says No Jim heres a way

Dwight:
Theres one other thing and this is important Lets keep this alliance totally a secret Dont tell anyone

Pam:
An alliance

Goodnight have a good night Thank you Angela

Michael:
TMI Too much information I used to say Dont go there but that is so lame now Or You go girl Or Um when did Wheres the beef That was like a long long time ago Its funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like Too much information probably came on the scene I mean I didnt hear it till like this month so its pretty recently Um but you know theyre generally good for like no more than five or six years

Toby:
Yes thats true I have never won a Dundie I am more than okay  with that

Angela:
Yes Im the designated driver which is very important We need everyone to get home safely sighs But no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over Its expensive

Dwight:
scoffs Like a gaggle of geese jibbering mockingly

Michael:
All right we need something for Kevin

Jim:
Mmmhmmm

Michael:
What do we know about him Hes an accountant

Michael:
talking over Jim Hes fat The fat accountant award

Jim:
Well you seem to have this under control

Jim:
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational I mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year Which is probably why this branch will be downsized

Michael:
I am the fat accountant

Dwight:
Michael I need to talk to you

Michael:
Here he is

Michael:
Really What did they say For a good time call Michael Scott

Jim:
Good one

Dwight:
Uh no no No I think something bad maybe

Michael:

Dwight:
Michael

Michael:
Do you want me to find out what it says

Michael:
Yes

Dwight:
By any means necessary

Michael:
What does that even mean What are you What are you talking about

Michael:
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me But dont tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me I will say that you are crazy

Michael:
Thank you You wont regret this Michael

Jim:
What award would you like to give Dwight

Michael:
I hadnt planned on including him

Jim:
Okay

Michael:
Kevin

Dwight:
It hasnt always been easy being a whistleblower When I was in school the kids would call me a tattletale or a snitch or a worm So I really identify with those women from Enron I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me but they never wrote back I guess theyre all married

Dwight:
Angela its simple Just tell me what the bathroom wall says

Dwight:

Dwight:

Dwight:
Would I ever leave this company Look Im all about loyalty In fact I feel like part of what Im getting paid for here is my loyalty But if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly Im going wherever they value loyalty the most

Oscar:

Oscar:
Oh fixes his dress

Pam:
Jim

Dwight:
This is called leveraging an offer walks into Michaels office Michael can I talk to you for a moment

Dwight:
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills

Dwight:

Out of loyalty to this company

Big deal Oh it wouldve worked out so well Can you get it back

Dwight:
Its in Maryland

Michael:
You can call Can you call em

Dwight:
I cant I I suppose I coul no They never really made me an offer anyway

Jim:
Honestly I dont think Michael has the slightest clue of who hes gonna  fire I think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer Uh or be run over by a bus before the deadline But in the end really whats going to happen is its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall And therein lies the true essence of his charisma

Michael:
clearing his throat and interrupting Jims talking head Can I speak to you a minute

Michael:
Help Me

Dwight:
Next suggestion

Michael:
Arrr dooby dooby do You need to do something about your BO

Dwight:
You need to do something about your BO

Toby:
Arent the suggestions meant for you

Michael:
Well Toby if by me you are inferring that I have BO then I would say that is a very poor choice of words

Creed:
Uh Michael he wasnt inferring he was implying  You were inferring

Michael:
Was I Creed  Ok well you know what I am implying is that when were on an elevator together I should maybe take the stairs because talk about stank  Not that I would ever say something like that in public and I never have and I never will I just think its something that we should all be aware of  Ok  Now that weve learned this lets continue  See this is good were learning and were figuring some stuff out  You need to do something about your coffee breath

Dwight:
You need

Michael:
Ok

Dwight:
To do something about

Michael:
Shut up shut up shut up Dwight OK I dont think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box

Michael:
Yeah is that hard for you  Alright well

Lets keep going  Keep it going  Yep  What do we have here  We have somebodys piece of gum  Somebody put a piece of gum in there  This is not a a garbage can this is the future of our company  This is not a place for gum  I dont wanna have to read these tomorrow

Jan:

Jan:
What Michael

Dwight:
loud metal music playing in a stairwell Dwight pacing You are giving me this raise  I deserve this raise plays air guitar Yes kicks Yes Yes Hiya  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation Keeya eyah  Yes  Why are you gonna give me this raise  Why  Because Im awesome I am awesome

Michael:
I just dont understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened

Jan:
Because nothing did Michael  It Im not going to say anything more about it and I would advise that you do the same

Michael:
Look

Michael:
Oh my God

Dwight:
Im sorry am I interrupting  Oh God were you guys making out

Jan:

Dwight:

Michael:
You wanna talk now good OK Dwight leave

Dwight:
Uh wait I would like to discuss my raise

Michael:
Why on earth would we give you a raise

Dwight:
That is an excellent question Thank you for asking  Let me bring up one word dedication points to graphs I have never been late  Also I have never missed a day due to illness Michael sighs Even when I had walking pneumonia  I even come in on holidays

Michael:
You do  How do you get in

Dwight:
I have a copy of your key

Jan:
Thats a serious offense

Michael:
That is a serious offense Very serious  As is toying with a mans heart

Dwight:
Id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace

Michael:
Ok third wheel why dont you do that

Dwight:
For instance the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office

Michael:
That was deer Gross oh

Michael:
Oh did not

Dwight:
Jan have you ever had deer

Jan:
No

Dwight:
Its a delicacy  And you know what  Its an aphrodisiac  So when were done here you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge sample some deer and talk about my raise

Michael:
What do you say Jan

Jan:
Ok Heres what Im gonna do Im gonna step outside collect my thoughts and I will return in about ten minutes

Michael:
Ok You just uh clear your head

Jan:
Dwight opens door Thank you Dwight

Dwight:
And in conclusion I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said Dad you have no idea what Im capable of

Michael:
Thats from Superman

Dwight:
Smallville  And that is why I feel that I deserve this raise

Pam:
Do you think Michael and Jan actually

Jim:
I dont really wanna picture it  But thank you Pam

Pam:
How do you come back from that

Jim:
Um you dont I dont think come all the way back you know  Especially working together

Jan:

Jan:

Dwight:
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying The liar will avoid direct eye contact The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands especially the mouth  The liar will perspire  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful

Michael:

Kelly:
to Jim Im serious  My closet doors will not shut  I mean it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because arent all hangers like that big  So I dont understand why the closet engineer didnt think of that  So now Im doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit

Michael:
You know who used to sit at that desk

Dwight:
No

Michael:
Yeah

Dwight:
I thought he was out on the road

Dwight:
Ah

Michael:
When I was in training many years ago not so long ago I worked sidebyside with a fellow named Todd Packer and together we rocked the office picture behind Michael falls  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off and when people noticed we convinced them that

Stanley:
on phone Excuse me one second please to Michael What is it that you need right now that you cant wait until Im off the phone with a customer

Michael:
Oh a customer well sound the alarm laughs Okay

Pam:
Well I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs Plant flowers on it stuff like that Since I was a girl Um More seriously though a husband that I love Roy And I love to draw And I I did a little in college and Id still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way

Phyllis:
Shes real good

Pam:
Thanks

Jan:
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York

Pam:
Well I have a job right now so I cant really take time off

Jan:
Well its only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York but Im sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out

Jan:
There are always a million reasons not to do something

Michael:
Lets start with the Warehouse What bothers you as guys you know

Darryl:
My priority is safety

Michael:
OK

Darryl:
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift playing with it like a toy It kind of gets under my skin

Michael:
OK Yeah Yeah Yeah shhh

Darryl:
Uh uh uh Dont shush me

Michael:
I That was just

Darryl:
That bothers me too

Michael:
I hate shushing You know thats the thing What the ok what is our beef as human men

Lonny:
You know thats a good question Hasselhoff What bugs us

Michael:
OK Alright Good Guys ragging on each other Thats what guys do and we love it

Phyllis:
Im excited about today whispers I love girl talk

Jan:
Dress for the job you want not the job you have All right You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be

Angela:
Im not gaining anything from this seminar Im a professional woman The head of accounting Im in the healthiest relationship of my life I just think its insulting that Jan thinks we need this And apparently judging from her outfit Jan aspires to be a whore

Roy:
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like When are we going to go on a datedate

Guy:
I hate that too general clapping and agreement

Darryl:
I hate that too

Kevin:
That sucks so much

Guy:
It totally sucks

Dwight:
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning Like Gas aint free

Michael:
I feel you

Darryl:
No you dont You dont feel us How can you You know what

Dwight:
Not literally

Darryl:
You say were the same but we get compensated very differently

Michael:
Yes

Darryl:
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder

Michael:
Ah you do So

Darryl:
But we get paid a lot less

Dwight:
Word

Roy:
Like next to no benefits

Michael:
I know God What is that

Roy:
Exactly

Michael:
It blows It blows man Gah

Darryl:
You know this would not happen if we had a union

Roy:
Thats what Im talking about

Michael:
No Whoa whoa Yeah

Roy:
Absolutely

Darryl:
Thats what we need

Guy:
You know youre right

Darryl:
Man see Thats what Ive been sayin man We need to do this finally

Michael:
You know what Is that necessary Because you already sorta have a union of guys

Darryl:
Its more than necessary Mike We need this Roy You still have that card from the Dockworkers Union

Roy:
In my truck

Darryl:
Man hook you up

Men:
generalized clapping

Guy:
Come on man

Michael:
Yeah You know what I think the problem is the chicks

Darryl:
Union Union yeah

Michael:
The problem is the chicks And you gotta blame them

Darryl:
Are you with us Mike

Michael:
Yeahes

Darryl:
Welcome to the warehouse

Jan:
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women Im sure that all of you have felt that before

Michael:
knocks This is important Ladies take a breather Jan I uh wanna Can I help you Um I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union And they have some good points

Jan:
What A union What

Jan:
Im not

Michael:
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women

Michael:
Lets be rational here What are the pros What are the cons

Michael:
Dont talk to me that way please Just theyre going to want to hear this from you

Jan:
You got yourself into this Michael so you get yourself out

Michael:
But were bonding down there

Jan:
Thats too bad

Michael:
I mean I just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear

Jan:
I dont want to

Michael:
Ok Come on Jan After all weve been through

Jan:
Michael Michael Michael

Michael:
We have a history

Jan:
Michael

Michael:
between us

Jan:
Dont say another word

Michael:
Im just saying we have something Ok Whatever

Ryan:
You know what we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line

Jan:
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office Now I know this might sound silly but a  many women ask to go over it So Fumble means

Phyllis:
Mistake

Meredith:
Slip

Jan:
Right Par for the course is a golf term It means right on track Below par means worse Wait that should mean better that doesnt make sense

Kelly:
What about second base Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you Does that mean you like closed a deal

Jan:
Excuse me

Kelly:
I mean thats a baseball term right

Kelly:
in the background and you went to Chilis and he got to second base with you

Jan:
in the background Kelly I dont know what Michaels talking about

Kelly:
in the background He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term

Pam:
Hey

Jim:
Hey

Pam:
Hows it going down there

Jim:
Its a complete well actually its exactly what youd expect so How are the girls

Pam:
Good We watched a video about our changing bodies

Jim:
Did you really

Pam:
No laughs

Jim:
Oh

Pam:
Almost

Jim:
Good

Pam:
Um but hey Something kind of cool Theres this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about She made it sound like really great

Jim:
Nice Well whats it all about

Pam:
Um

Jim:
I think you should do it Thats great

Pam:
Its really cool

Michael:
Cold front coming into the Warehouse Uh oh Better put on your ski boots Woohoohoowoo Waaaah Happy New Year Darryl HeyDarryl You ever done this

Phyllis:
That must have been hard

Jan:
It was Yes

Kelly:
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with Michael

Jan:
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff

Phyllis:
Mmmm I think were all okay with the balance weve struck

Jan:
Okay Lets take five I think we can all use five

Michael:
Hi

Jan:
Did you take care of the situation

Michael:
Yuh yuh yes I I have essentially

Michael:
I have essentially Yes Ive taken some

Jan:
Excuse me Ive been told theres been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it Obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts So let me If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that snaps her fingers They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message If you have any further questions you can direct them to to Michael

Pam:
Dreams are just that Theyre dreams They help get you through the day Like the thing about the terrace Its nice but um I dont know It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that Just always kind of stuck with me

Jim:
So youre not doing it

Pam:
How did you know

Jim:
Why not

Pam:
Just like no big reason Just a bunch of little reasons

Jim:
Come on

Jim:
Roy said that

Pam:
What You have something you want to say

Jim:
You got to take a chance on something sometime Pam I mean do you want to be a receptionist here always

Pam:
Oh excuse me Im fine with my choices

Jim:

Pam:

Michael:

Michael:
Pizza Great equalizer Rich people love pizza  Poor people love pizza  White people love pizza  Black people love pizza  Do black people like pizza

Michael:

Jim:

Dwight:
And they do your parents love you very much

Dwight:
The Schrutes consider children very valuable In the olden days the women would bear many children so we would have enough laborers to work the fields And if it was an especially cold winter and there werent enough grains or vegetables they would eat the weakest of the brood Laughs They didnt eat the children

So the first time we went out to dinner it was like whatever fine but I was so nervous So this time I wanted to be special so I bought a new dress Jim hunches his shoulders and grins One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something but not everything Jim shakes his head no in agreement I mean not everything Jim Jim shakes his head in agreement I promise Im not that kind of

Kelly:
Were having the best conversation  Jim eyes wide shakes his head no

Kelly:
So I was looking so hot

Michael:
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about

Angela:
No not at all

Oscar:
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc

Michael:
No uh no That was a test  I was testing you and you all failed Miserably When I said that Dwight was a narc how many of you defended him  How many of you said Hey you know what hes right What hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs

Michael:
Drugs ruin lives people Drugs destroy careers Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot  I want everybody to take a look to their left Now I want everybody to take a look to their right One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children

Stanley:
Where did you get these facts

Michael:
Are these facts scaring you or are they not

Stanley:
They are not

Michael:
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool Do you think that doing alcohol is cool

Stanley:
No I dont I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week  For the antioxidants

Michael:
Okay enough enough enough I have written down a list of illegal drugs Take a gander How many of these are you familiar with

Toby:
No its not Its a type of pipe You can fill it with tobacco often mixed with fruit or other flavors

Michael:
Okay you know what Toby Pam can you take this down Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad In addition to Tobys urine being tested I would like to test his blood and his hair

Toby:
You cant do that

Michael:
I can test anyone randomly and I have chosen you randomly

Toby:
Thats not random

Michael:
Okay eeny meenie miney moe is random  Okay you know what Im going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives or the lives of a loved one  Yeah Pam

Michael:
Really Jim shakes his head no

Pam:
Uh hmmm

Pam:
Wow He really pulled out the big guns Fake crying Did not expect that

Michael:
The point Im trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs I hate them and based upon what I have seen you all dont quite hate em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test and I am not

Dwight:
No you will be tested

Michael:
Yes I will not be

Dwight:
You will be That is the law according to the rules

Michael:
Okay well Dwight just know that Ive been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasnt planning on going to the bathroom and I dont even know if anything is going to come out okay So good Thank you

Michael:

WinWin is number four and number five is winwinwin The important difference here is with winwinwin we all win Me too I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work

Michael:
in front of poster Okay since this is the disputed poster Now one at a time I want you to express your feelings using I emotion language and no judging or you statements

Angela:
I got this poster for Christmas and I feel I want to see it everyday It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and God has a really cute sense of humor

Oscar:
I dont like looking at it Its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me It makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it Its kitsch Its the opposite of art It destroys art It destroys souls This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno Im talking about the

Pam:
Win

Michael:
Yes Thank you Pam How about Angela makes the poster into a tshirt which Oscar wears That way he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar she can see it Winwinwin

Oscar:

Michael:
Ohh God Alright Why do I have to do everything

Photographer:

Photographer:

Pam:
Nice

Toby:
Actually I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael This unlocks a draweris January through March of this year pulls out a fairly large folder

Michael:
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee looks at all the employees most of whom raise their hands And did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to you forget about your problem and you move on employees mumble merely listen to and forgotten  That is outrageous I love this place and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering sighs Okay today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved Alright how about the PhyllisAngela dispute

Angela:
You already did me

Michael:
Thats what she said Jim mouths these words along with Michael The thing is Angela you are in here an awful lot You have complained about everybody in the office except Dwight which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight Toby by the way what does redacted mean There is a file full of complaints in here marked redacted 

Michael:
Oh ok There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago

Dwight:
Whoa wha wait If someone has a problem with me why would they withdraw it six months ago

Pam:
notices Angelas intense concern Um lets move on I volunteer Did anyone have a problem with me

Michael:
All right Pamela Come on down Lets do it And looks through the file okay Just one complaint Actually it has been withdrawn So that is no help to us Next

Michael:

Michael:
crumbles up the complaint paper Makin progress Jim raises his hand Yes

Michael:

Jim:

Dwight:
That is not true Redact it Redact it

Dwight:

Toby:
Sure

Pam:
gets up and walks over to Angela whispering to her Hey Thanks for ratting me out

Michael:
still of camera You got a lot of anger under there buddy Come on start us out Unleash it

Anglea:
I didnt do it Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera but its inaudible

Pam:
I find that hard to believe considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe

Stanley:
I didnt say that

Creed:
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door Michael along with the camera look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door

Michael:

Toby:

Pam:
I cant believe Angela I went against my better judgment and I gave her a Save The Date And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby

Jim:

Pam:
I dont know I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff

Jim:
You mean your thoughts and feelings

Pam:
Yeah

Jim:

Phyllis:

Michael:
Okay well all settled then

Phyllis:
whispering to Angela I dont like you

Michael:
OK Ryan  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell

Creed:
I know exactly what hes talking about I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer Very nutritious But they smell like death

Michael:
All right Kevin You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable Solution  Angela you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable

Kevin:
I accept your decision

Jim:
Hey you know what Dwight Maybe we should get our photo ID taken together

Dwight:
That doesnt make any sense

Photographer:

Dwight:

Dwight:
Im the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken

Michael:
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby And they cant decide so they bring the baby to a wise man Just like a manager in those days And the wise man says I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu See They didnt expect that And that fixed it Because I think he was the dad anyway

Michael:
There are dozens of old complaints in here Cold cases like the show imitating gonging And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murdersuicides are not important enough to solve Well you know what I have a problem with that And Im going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person

Photographer:
All right

Pam:

Angela:
You have to pick an approved nonprofit organization

Creed:
Theres a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton Delicious pea soup on Thursdays Ill probably give the money to them

Kelly:
Kobe Bryant has a foundation and he is

Angela:
We are giving money that has been gambled Why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves  and donate that money to charity

Michael:
Oh and another fun thing We at the end of the night are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts Right Toby Were gonna

Toby:
Actually I didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its You know theres gambling and alcohol and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night And you know Hooters is catering You know is that enough Should I keep going

Michael:
Why are you the way that you are Honestly every time I try to do something fun or exciting you make it not that way I hate so much about the things that you choose to be Okay you know what I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief since apparently it doesnt exist I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS

Hey Okay You know what Dont even think I command you to just go down and have fun tonight All right Dont think about it

Michael:
Our numbers are down yes but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton Hardworking motivated dynamic Every single last one of them They follow my lead I sort of set the tone And it doesnt hurt that my ex works for corporate Jan loves this branch and I think thats really more than half the battle

Pam:
It is extremely stressful planning a wedding by yourself Its like a job I mean its fun but it kind of becomes like work Ive already planned it all out in my head But its just in my head

Meredith's Vet:
Hey Meredith right

Meredith:
Oh God Oh no I have this problem all the time I never remember people Ive had sex with

Michael:
No  That is the fun of this place  I call everybody faggie Why would anybody find that offensive

Toby:
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used lame or something like that

Toby:
No not really

Toby:
Apparently you called Oscar faggie for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie

Michael:
It wasnt just an action movie it was Die Hard

Toby:
All right Michael but Oscars really gay

Michael:
Yeah I know

Toby:
No I mean hes attracted to other men

Michael:
OK a little too far crossed the line

Toby:
OK I am telling you Oscar is an actual homosexual  Yeah he told me this morning  And obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion

Michael:
I would have never called him that if I knew  You dont You dont call retarded people retards  Its bad taste  You call your friends retards when theyre acting retarded  And I consider Oscar a friend

Michael:
Listen man I am so sorry  I had no idea

Oscar:
No its fine

Michael:
No  No its not  I feel terrible about it  I have been calling people faggie since I was in junior high and I have never made this mistake  If I dont know how to behave it is because I am just so far the opposite way you know  Im just I I cant even imagine the thing  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime  And you could tell me how you do that to another dude

Angela:
in reference to Oscar being gay It explains so much

Oscar:
No Im not gay  And I dont understand why anyone would think that Im gay if sighs Uh yeah Im gay

Jim:
I cant say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable sir but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable

Jim:
Why did I transfer to Stamford  I think thats pretty obvious  I got promoted  And you cant beat that view right

Andy:
Hey Big Tuna  Youre single right

Jim:
Uhhuh yeah  I am

Jim:
OooOK

Andy:
OooOK

Jim:
I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day  So Andy started calling me Big Tuna  I dont think any of them actually know my real name

Andy:
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy you know  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy but I mean Im not threatened by him  I went to Cornell you ever heard of it laughs  I graduated in four years  I never studied once  I was drunk the whole time and I sang in the acappella group Here Comes Treble

Josh:

Michael:

Dwight:
Well hes not dressed in womens clothes so

Michael:
deep sigh There could be others  I need to know  I dont want to offend anybody else

Michael:
Hey what about Angela   Shes hard and severe  She could be a gay woman

Dwight:
I really dont think so

Michael:
I dont know I can imagine her with another woman cant you

Michael:
Do some research  Find out if theres a way to tell by just looking at them

Dwight:
Jim told me you could buy gaydar online

Michael:
Thats ridiculous

Michael:
sighs Lets call him and get the website

Dwight:
Definitely

Jim:

Michael:
Well theyre sold out

Dwight:
Damn  thinks  Ill try Brookstone

Pam:

Roy:

Roy:
Good glad  OK

Roy:
After Pam dumped me I um I kinda stopped taking care of myself there and uh I hit bottom when uh drunk driving arrest  Ive been working out and um you know Im not gonna take her for granted  I gotta win her back

Kelly:
That is so cool that youre gay  I totally underestimated you

Oscar:
Yes Im super cool  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company Scranton  Much like um sir Ian McClellan

Angela:
Sure sometimes I watch Will and Grace and I want to throw up  Its terribly loud  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr is on  Hes so talented

Andy:
OK  Who put my calculator in Jello  Good one  But uh seriously guys who did this  Seriously guys who did this  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello or Im gonna lose MY FRICKIN MIND

Jan:
You know its amazing to me that in this day and age you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation

Michael:
I watch the L Word  I watch Queer as F so

Jan:
Thats not what its called

Toby:
OK Michael are you aware that you ousted Oscar today

Michael:
What  What does that even

Michael:
I think Angela might be gay  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair  Maybe  Is that what this is about

Jan:
NO

Michael:
I dont kn

Jan:
No its not possible

Michael:
Anythings possible

Jan:
You know imagine you were gay

Jan:
Michael your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now  Do you understand

Michael:
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100000 years of being weirded out by gays

Oscar:
Am I the first gay man you ever knew

Pam:
Michael Dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer

Dwight:
Uh Michael knows Pam  He asked me to do this just for him  He has his own reasons

Michael:
looking at gay porn Nothing wrong with this stuff  At all  This is fine  You know what  Gay porn straight porn its all goooooood  I dont particularly get into this  But uh you know what  I totally see the merit  And actually it is quite beautiful

Dwight:
Ah damn popups

Oscar:
What are you doing

Angela:
Watching some of your friends

Michael:
yelling All right everybody in the conference room  I dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight  JUST GET IN HERE  RIGHT NOW

Michael:
Did you know that gay used to mean happy  When I was growing up it meant lame  And now it means a man who makes love to other men

Michael:
Were all homos  Homosapiens  Gays arent necessarily who you think they are people  I mean anybody could be gay  Businessmen  Like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants  Oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here  However you want to do it  Go ahead  Stand up  Im doing this for you

Oscar:
Yes Im gay  And I didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever  Can I sit down now

Creed:
 Im not offended by homosexuality  In the sixties I made love to many many women often outdoors in the mud and the rain  And it was possible a man slipped in and there would be no way of knowing

Michael:
Who should be the judges and juries of our society

Angela:
Judges and juries

Michael:
Yes thats a good point  She has a good point  Because gay marriage currently is not legal under US law  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could  You know  Sounds pretty good right

Kevin:
 That sounds great

Dwight:
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves or I will do it for them

Oscar:
No one else in this office is gay

Dwight:
What about Phyllis  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine

Phyllis:
Im getting married to Bob Vance

Michael:
Thats great  Congratulations Phyllis  That is great and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing  laughs See  Everybody has a chance

Michael:
But still Phyllis in college  Did you ever experiment with other women  A lot of women do

Phyllis:
No you knew me in high school  Course we all thought you were gay in high school

Michael:
laughing Right  serious And I take that as a compliment

Phyllis:
Well with your ties and your matching socks and 

Michael:
Well I just like to look good OK so 

Oscar:
You sound pretty defensive Michael

Michael:
No I am just coming out myself  I am coming out hetero

Michael:
No no no  The only signal that I am sending is

Michael:
Look if I was gay I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just I would be waving that rainbow flag

Oscar:
I dont think I can work here any longer  This has been the worst most backwards day of my life

Michael:
You misunderstand OK  You know what OK  I uh Im gonna put my money where my mouth is  You ready  I am going to embrace Oscar  You might want to watch this Angela because you cant catch anything  Here we go  We are going to make a statement  You and I are going to make a statement together  Oscar is my friend 

Michael:
and I just dont care who sees it doesnt bother me

Oscar:
No NO  I dont want to touch you ever consider that  Youre ignorant and insulting and small

Michael:
All right um sorry

Oscar:
Michael Im sorry  That was a good idea  Come on come on Oscar and Michael hug

Michael:
sobbing Im sorry I called you faggie  Youre not faggie  Youre a a good guy

Dwight:
Michael appears to be gay too  And yet he is my friend  I guess I do have a gay friend

Michael:
embracing OscarYou know what Im going to raise the stakes  I want you to watch this  And I want you to burn this into your brains  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this  awkwardly kissing Oscar  I did it  See  Im still here  Were all still here everyone claps

Michael:
Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar  Oh come on  Dwight  Come on man

Michael:
We are not in the playground anymore  There are new rules  We have to be mature  But we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder  What is love  anyway  Maybe its supposed to break all the rules  Like me and Jan  Or Oscar and some guy  Life is short  When two people find each other what should stand in their way

Michael:
I am glad that today spurred social change  Thats part of my job as regional manager  But you know what  Even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed  thats what she said  Or he said

Dwight:
reading the note with the gaydar  Hope this helps  Jim  Nice

Oscar:
Dwight is running the gaydar over Oscars body  What are you doing

Dwight:
Shhh  Dont be scared  gaydar beeps over Oscars belt buckle Dwight smiles It works  gaydar goes off next to Dwights belt buckle  oh no

Jan:

Creed:
Its a real shame about Ed huh

Michael:

Creed:
About what

Michael:
The older you get the bigger the chance is youre gonna die  You knew that

Creed:
Ed was decapitated

Michael:
What

Dwight:
Really

Creed:
He was drunk as a skunk he was flying down Route 6  He slides under an 18 wheeler  Pop  It snaps right off

Dwight:
That is the way to go  Instant death  Very smart

Dwight:
Youre thinking of a chicken

Michael:
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go Im sorry  Alone out of the blue and not even have his own head to comfort him

Michael:
clears throat So Im not exactly sure how to say this

Dwight:
Ed was decapitated

Michael:
What are you doing

Dwight:
You said you didnt know how to say it

Michael:
I didnt he was driving on the road and he went under a truck  And thats when his head was separated from the rest of him  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out

Dwight:
Hey

Dwight:
If my head ever comes off I would like you to put it on ice

Angela:
I do not wanna talk about this

Dwight:
When I die I wanna be frozen And if they have to freeze me in pieces so be it  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in

Jan:
on speakerphone I understand how you feel Michael  I really do  So would it be helpful to give everyone the day off

Michael:
You really dont get it do you  You dont understand these people  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off

Jan:
Well what would you suggest

Michael:
thoughtfully A statue

Jan:
Of Ed

Jan:
scoffs Im not sure thats realistic

Jan:
No thats not

Michael:
We could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move

Dwight:
That is not a statue that is a robot

Michael:
I think that is a great way to honor Ed

Dwight:
And how big do you want this robot

Michael:
Lifesize

Dwight:
Mm no  Better make it twothirds  Easier to stop if it turns on us

Jan:
What the hell are you two talking about

Michael:
Well we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company Jan

Jan:
You know what Michael  Ive really tried with you today

Michael:
Mm hm

Jan:

Michael:
Oh do you  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck

Jan:
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation

Michael:
There are five stages to grief which are glancing at computer screen denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance  And right now out there theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad  And thats   hard  And its making them all angry  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance  And if not acceptance then just depression  If I can get them depressed then Ill have done my job

Pam:
Id also like to say a few words if thats okay

Kevin:
Oh I remember that  That was SO funny

Dwight:
Hes not a songbird

Pam:
An impression then  Lastly we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesnt mean he was alone  Because Im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much  He will not be forgotten

Angela:
quickly Amen

Dwight:
begins playing recorder

Pam:
singing Just smile for me and let the day begin  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love 

Michael:
Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong Well thats baloney because grief isnt wrong There is such a thing as good grief Just ask Charlie Brown

Dwight:
Lets get back to work

Hannah:
Hey Jimmy Want to see some pictures of my baby

Jim:

Hannah:

Jim:

Hannah:

Hannah:
You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone Jim shakes head Talk to me when you have kids

Jim:
Sounds good

Jan:
on the phone Ed Truck died over the weekend

Michael:
Oh wow He

Jan:
Yeah And I know I know he was your boss so I thought you should know

Michael:
Does his family know

Jan:
Yes they know Michael

Michael:
But Im the first in the office

Michael:
Ed Truck died And it blows They say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so Ive had more time to be sad

Dwight:
Attention everyone As you know Ed Truck is dead If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook remove it now Also if you have any photographs Pam will make her shredder available during lunch That is all

Michael:
I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor We need to find out what is blocking you And that way well be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored May he rest in peace

Kevin:
ces chuckles

Kevin:
Nothing

Michael:
No you said something didnt you

Kevin:
May he rest in pieces chuckles You know because theres like two pieces of him

Michael:
You think thats funny

Kevin:
No chuckles

Michael:
You are disgusting

Dwight:
Michael no need to call corporate We are supposed to use Toby Hes trained as a grief counselor

Michael:
No that cant be right

Roy:
Hey there

Roy:
So hows your day going

Pam:
Well I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone Ive never met

Pam:
Closer to the epicenter I guess

Toby:
Well as you know Ed Truck passed away So Im here to talk about it if anyone would like to

Kevin:
Not really

Michael:
Youre ruining it already They should not be given the choice

Toby:
Is anyone having any trouble eating

Kevin:
No

Stanley:
Im having trouble getting my work done today

Toby:
Michael Im sorry

Michael:
No No Shh Enough It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here Dwight Ryan I want you to take the table out Were gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back were going to start with a clean slate and in the interim I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said okay

Michael:
I dont think Im overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company And he is worthless You give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would Grief counseling is not about Are you hungry Would you like a sandwich These people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats

Michael:
Okay part of the problem was that Toby talked at you Now I am going to talk with you First off I want you to be comfortable because you really cant grieve if youre all tight and buttoned up So guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want Ladies let your hair down You know what Even take your shoes off I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said

Angela:
Okay I dont think Kevin should take his shoes off

Kevin:
My feet do not smell Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition

Michael:
I found an exercise in Tobys binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says I dont wanna do that I dont wanna talk about that That is too private Heres how it works Im going to throw you this ball

Roy:
Hey my cousin Billy they just had the twins

Pam:
Wow I thought that was supposed to be like next month

Roy:
Yeah I know I guess they couldnt wait Ill bring in a picture if you

Pam:
Yeah Id love to see them Oh and tell them I say Congratulations

Roy:
Yeah

Roy:
No problem

Michael:

Josh:

Because you think hes black

Kevin:
He is black right And

Jan:
Okay its someone named Martin Nash

Kevin:
Yeah

Jan:
Michael

Michael:
Why did the convict have to be a black guy It is such a stereotype I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice Like a white guy who went to prison for polluting a black guys lake

Kevin:
I wonder what he did

Michael:
In our society a black man can be arrested for almost anything He was probably at a sporting event and saw some people pushing each other and he intervened

Pam:
Why would anyone go to jail for that

Michael:
Sssssso what we need to do is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people

Kevin:
Cool

Pam:
Okay Angela

Angela:
Sure Lets protect the convicts At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace As a 90pound female that sits in an illlit rarelyvisited corner of the office naturally I agree with that

Dwight:
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office And I do not care if that convict is white black Asian German or some kind of halfsy I do not like criminals

Michael:
You know what Lets get right down to it DunderMifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse but what we lack in flash we will make up for with hardwork and decency

Buyer:
Uh I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company Weve had some problems in the past

Michael:
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company we will give you the care and attention of a small company

Andy:
Oh man that is like poetry

Michael:
No

Andy:
I swear this guy could sell paper to a tree

Michael:
Stop it Puts his hand on Andys shoulder Stop it

Ryan:
If you bring your boss to class it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade So Id be stupid

A boss is like a teacher And I am like the cool teacher Like Mr Handell Mr Handell would hang out with us and he would tell us awesome jokes And he actually hooked up with one of the students Um and then like twelve other kids came forward It was in all the papers  Really ruined eighth grade for us

Michael:
Here we go College Roadshow Gotta bring our A game What was the most inspiring thing Ive ever said to you

Dwight:
Whenever Im about to do something I think Would an idiot do that And if they would I do not do that thing

Michael:
Will they throw their hats you think

Ryan:

Michael:
A lot of times at a school or naval academy after a rousing speech the crowd would throw its hats high into the air

Ryan:
YYou understand nobodys graduating

Michael:
Yeah I know I know Im just saying if they did throw their hats Ive got a great line for that May your hats fly as high as your dreams  That was a pretty good line

Karen:
Oh my God

Stanley:
Goooood bye

Angela:
on ground  Please dont let that stupid thing near me

Michael:
Okay this is it Ryan is doing my intro right now

Ryan:
DunderMifflin cant compete with the modern chains and management is unwilling or unable to adapt Their customers are dying off

Michael:
I cant hear what hes saying but he looks like hes really into it

Dwight:
We have a bat in the office

Toby:
The simple solution would be to open a window if we had windows that could open

Angela:
Poop is raining from the ceilings Poop

Jim:
That bread on your desk I just picked it up Its white hot

Karen:
But Jim this garlic bread is cold

Jim:
What  No It burned me I bizarre

Dwight:
No no One crisis at a time

Dwight:
If a vampire bat was in the US it would make sense for it to come to a sylvania Like PENNsylvania Now that doesnt mean that Jim is going to become a vampire Only that he carries the vampiric germ

Michael:
So you wanna start a business How do you start What do you need Well first of all you need a building And secondly you need supply You need something to sell Now this could be anything It could be a thingamajig Or a a whosiwhatsi Or pulls out a candy bar a Whatchamacallit throws bar Now you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay takes out a PayDay throws it And if you sell enough of them you will make a 100 Grand throws 100 Grand bar pulls out a Snickers Satisfied

Ryan:
Michael

Michael:
And products

Ryan:
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing

Michael:
Well okay I was just kind of getting it going Um alright Well okay we can do questions Okay Very good First hand up

Business Student #1:
Sir as a company that primary distributes paper how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world

Michael:
We cant overestimate the value of computers Yes they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails But real business is done on paper okay Write that down everyone types on their laptops

Karen:
Hey Jim heres the aspirin you wanted

Jim:
Oh thank God I have such a headache from that glare

Karen:
What glare

Jim:
The glare off Angelas crucifix Its blinding

Dwight:
I dont have a lot of experience with vampires but I have hunted werewolves I shot one once But by the time I got to it it had turned back into my neighbors dog

Creed:
Sure

Dwight:
to use sudden violence

Creed:
Okay

Dwight:
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake

Business Student #2:
What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain

Michael:

Business Student #2:
Has anyone ever come back

Michael:
Yeah sure you know business sitting up here in your ivory tower And your ebony tower You know what Tell you one thing DunderMifflin is here to stay

Business Student #2:

Michael:
David will always beat Goliath

Business Student #1:

Michael:
Yeah yeah You know what else is facing five Goliaths America AlQaeda global warming sex predators mercury poisoning So do we just give up Is that what were learning in business school

Business Student #1:

Michael:
DunderMifflin is the big picture Cant you understand that No you cant Youre too young Ryan has never made a sale And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita And everybody thinks hes a tease Well you know what He doesnt know anything and neither do you walks out SO SUCK ON THAT

Michael:

Jan:

Michael:
Im not going to cry I feel like it but I am not going to Why dont you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces

Jan:
It was never a love contract Michael and besides I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him

Dwight:
Why would the architect design stairs this wide  Was there an obese family in here before you

Dwight:
How convenient

Jan:
I am attracted to weird wrong men  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman  Life has been complicated  Ive made some decisions that Im not proud of my marriage being overly litigious with my family  I orgasm fairly easily Michael was kind of like my dirty secret you know having sex with him oh I was just turned on by my own degradation  Um why anyway I was told by somebody recently that I respect that Im old enough to have a mature relationship and thats what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes

Melissa:

Ryan:

Melissa:

Ryan:
Um you ah you gotta give me a hint  Um did you meet me at the gym

Melissa:

Stanley:
No no no You planned this whole thing boy  Ill snatch your spine out your back

Dwight:
Space shuttle Which one  Oh Atlantis  Good thing its not the Discovery  You play soccer

Michael:
What a weird day  I dont understand it but you dont get to understand everyday of your life  Maybe five ten days a year Ill get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened  Guess everybody has days like that  Sometimes theyre the nicest ones  Still I think there might be something wrong with Jan

Karen:
So do you want to see it or not

Jim:
I dont know  Feel like Friday night crowds

Karen:
Oh my God youre like agoraphobic

Jim:
Agoraphobic

Karen:
Yeah

Jim:

Karen:
Yeah  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend

Jim:
Absolutely correct

Kevin:
Later Jim

Jim:
Kev have a good weekend

Jim:
Here we go

Karen:
And then were gonna go to the movies

Jim:

Roy:
Hey Halpert

Jim:

Pam:
ROY

Karen:

Pam:
Roy dont Dwight peppersprays Roy

Roy:
screams in pain Ahh God

Dwight:
Pam please call security

Dwight:
Everyday for eight years I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees  And everyday for eight years people have laughed at me  Well whos laughing now Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray

Michael:
No need for consternation everything is under control

Jan:
Michael last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office

Michael:
It was a crime of passion Jan not a disgruntled employee Everyone here is extremely gruntled

Jan:
sigh Is Toby there

Michael:
No

Jan:
Ok what what is the situation Toby

Toby:
Well we fired Roy obviously  And Jim wont press charges against Roy or the company

Jan:
Thank God

Toby:
Yeah um but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his

Michael:
No he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and hes just using this Roy thing as leverage

Jan:
All right well are you gonna take care of this

Michael:
Yeppers

Jan:
What did I tell you about yeppers

Michael:
I dont remember

Jan:
I told you not to say it  Do you remember that

Michael:
Yeesh

Pam:
I really dont want to talk about it  I dont mean to be rude but I just I dont want to comment on what happened  It

Jim:
I guess all things considered I was lucky Dwight was there  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars

Jim:
Hey man I never got a chance to thank you for stopping Roy  Thank you

Dwight:
Thank you not necessary and thus not accepted  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded

Dwight:
Dont want it

Jim:
You dont know what it is

Dwight:
Dont want it  Wont open it  Dont need it  Wont take it  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens

Jim:
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead  That would have made us even I think  He saves my life I get him a box for his desk toy  Even Steven

Dwight:
No dont call me a hero  Do you know who the real heroes are  The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs and get a distress call from the commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime  Those are the real heroes

Oscar:
Angela Roys check  Hes coming in later to pick it up

Kevin:
Man I cannot believe I missed the fight

Oscar:
It was crazy

Angela:
You saw it  Describe it please

Oscar:
It was insane

Angela:
flustered Well good for Dwight

Michael:
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you

Michael:
Wikipedia

Michael:
Wikipedia is the best thing ever  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject so you know you are getting the best possible information

Michael:
Ok Darryl ask me for a raise

Michael:
Hmm well thats interesting Darryl  I think mumbling softly that maybe you should mumbling jibberish

Jim:
I cant hear you

Michael:
What Im saying is that continues to mumble jibberish

Jim:
Still nothin

Michael:
Ok see what I did

Jim:
No

Michael:
By leaning back and by whispering I established a dominant physical position

Jim:
Nice

Jim:
Okay

Michael:
Walking out of the room unexpectedly

Jim:
And what happens in this one

Michael:
Its a surprise

Jim:
Okay

Michael:
gets up and begins to walk out of the room

Jim:
softly Sex Steve Martin Terri Hatcher

Jim:
What

Michael:
No what did you say

Michael:
Oh it sounded interesting what you were gonna

Dwight:
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed  His head was thrown back his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position  Perp grabbed the victim  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place

Toby:
Which is where

Dwight:
Irrelevant  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrators eyes nose and face area  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled  Then I contacted the authorities  The end

Toby:
Thanks Dwight

Kelly:
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard

Ryan:
I cant imagine what I would have done

Kelly:
I can  You would have left me to fend for myself  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed

Ryan:
Well that was funny thats why

Ryan:
Okay

Kelly:
and you call me to calm you down

Ryan:
You know what  I didnt

Toby:
Can you stop

Toby:
Theres a bunch of people back here maybe

Ryan:
Well dont talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night

Toby:
Guys

Kelly:
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you

Toby:
I dont think Michael intended to punish me by putting Ryan back here with Kelly  But if he did intend that  Wow  Genius

Michael:
knock on door Yeah

Darryl:
You ready for me

Michael:
Yes yeah absolutely  Have a seat

Michael:
You know what  Actually lets go into the conference room

Darryl:
Okay

Michael:
No you know what  Lets stay here  No lets go Yeah lets go to the conference room

Michael:
Tactic number six  Change the location of the meeting at the last second  Totally throws em off

Michael:
long pause I am declining to speak first

Darryl:
Okay Ill start  Its pretty simple really I uh I think I deserve a raise  Im scheduled to get one in six months but Id like that to be moved up to now

Darryl:
Are you wearin lady clothes

Michael:
What

Darryl:
Are you wearin lady clothes  Those look like lady pants

Michael:
No this is a power suit

Darryl:
That theres a womans suit

Michael:
Darryl laughs I do not buy womans clothes  I would not make that mistake again

Darryl:
Ima call Roy man

Michael:
Ohh kay

Darryl:
This is gonna make him feel better

Michael:
All right

Darryl:
This is too good

Michael:
Alright you know what  Pam could you please tell Darryl that this is not a womans suit

Pam:
Oh my God thats a womans suit

Kevin:
Youre wearing a womans suit

Michael:
No I do I I wear mens suits OK  I got this out of a bin

Michael:
There were these huge bins of clothes and everybody was rifling through them like crazy and I grabbed one  And it fit  So I dont think that this is totally just a womans suit  At the very least its bisexual

Kevin:
Who makes it

Michael:
Uh reading the inside of his jacket MISSterious  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side thats the mystery

Phyllis:
Look its got shoulderpads and did you see that lining

Michael:
Okay

Phyllis:
Did you see

Jim:
So none of that tipped you off

Michael:
Its European OK  Its a European cut

Pam:
Michael the pants dont have any pockets

Pam:
Laughing covering her mouth

Michael:
Italians dont wear pockets

Karen:
Hey maybe you want to come over and raid my closet

Michael:
No I dont want to do that because Im twice your size anyway

Darryl:
Yeah he look like Hillary Clinton

Michael:
Um lets just do this in 15 minutes

Michael:
Negotiations are all about controlling things  About being in the drivers seat  And make one tiny mistake youre dead  I made one tiny mistake  I wore womans clothes

Kevin:
Karen how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriends ass over another woman

Karen:
I feel great Kevin  Thank you

Karen:
Well you know it happened so fast I didnt really have time to be scared

Angela:
What happened exactly  I wasnt here so I havent really heard the whole story

Karen:
Um well Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry

Angela:
Mmhmm

Karen:
And hes a big dude you know  And all of a sudden Jim pushed me out of the way and Roy cocked his fist and then bam Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt

Angela:
flustered Goodness

Karen:
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings  Roy just attacked him  Im not sure which one Jim hated more

Darryl:
Well its simple Mike I mean we merged these two branches right  So now were shipping twice as many orders as we used to  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew  And Im pickin up all of his slack so I think I should be compensated fairly by gettin a raise

Michael:
mumbles jibberish

Darryl:
What  I cant hear you

Michael:
mumbling softly That was a very good point

Darryl:
I cant what Mike  Are you

Jim:
Yeah that was nuts

Jim:
No I mean you guys really seem to have a strong connection

Jim:
Well see  Im sure you guys will find you way back to one another someday

Pam:
Jim I am really sorry

Michael:
I am going to give you a piece of paper  I want you to write down how much you want and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me

Darryl:
Why cant I just tell you

Michael:
Because that is the way these things are done  In films Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael No slide slide it yes

Darryl:
There you go

Michael:
Oh scoffs Come on  Be serious

Darryl:
I am serious Mike  Thats a 10 raise  Thats what I want

Darryl:
Come on be for real Mike

Michael:
I dont  Want me to prove it to you  There is a pay stub

Darryl:
laughs Are you serious  Youre earning this

Michael:
Plus perks yes

Darryl:
Mike this is barely more than I make  You been here ten years dog laughs

Michael:
Fourteen years

Darryl:
Hoho

Michael:
No please please

Darryl:
Oh Im sorry Mike some of my folks got to hear about this one  texting on cell phone Ah laughs

Michael:
Ok lets take 15 again

Michael:
A bosss salary isnt just about money it is about perks  It for example every year I get a 100 gas card Cant put a price tag on that

Jim:
Ok if you dont want a gift at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something

Dwight:
No  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim whats your angle

Karen:
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks

Jim:
Well yes thats probably what it is  So what do I do

Karen:
Hmm  I dont know  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip

Kevin:
Michael heres the uh 15 I owe you

Michael:
Oh thank you

Toby:
Ok um one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome  Its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour  For your circulation youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh and move around about ten minutes every hour

Michael:
Yes good  Fine  Like stretching and

Toby:
Um yeah  Youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes so uh its also recommended that you step away for about about ten minutes every hour

Michael:
Wow that is that time really adds up  Thats like a half an hour every hour

Darryl:
Take them at the same time

Toby:
No no  Um you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty

Ryan:

Dwight:
I dont believe in apologies When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger And in that way save face And knowing the Japanese they probably get an even better prosthetic finger With a knife you can take out of it or a screwdriver or a corkscrew

Kelly:

Dwight:

Dwight:

Jim:
Lay it on me

Jim:
Now that sounds serious

Dwight:
Oh it is serious Five citations and youre looking at a violation Four of those and youll receive a verbal warning Keep it up and youre looking at a written warning Two of those thatll land you in a world of hurt in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior

Jim:

Toby:
I dont think the women in this office 

Michael:
Incidentally where were you during all of this Maybe youre the flasher

Toby:
I was at a parentteacher conference

Michael:
In all the excitement I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe Women cant have fun if they dont feel safe For example Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far Foliage And if one of us says that word the other one has to stop Although last time she pretended she didnt hear me

Jan:

Jan:

Michael:

Hunter:

Dwight:
Employees of this office are very small and delicate Deserve  protection from local pervs Better 1000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free

Michael:

Dwight:
Agreed Let me show you what Ive been working on

Michael:

Michael:
This is the last

Dwight:

Michael:
Dwight are those your pants Thats a Polaroid Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand

Attention everybody Dwight has something he would like to say

Dwight:
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis a man a map and his penis  I think you know what Im referring to  Michael has authorized me to form an emergency antiflashing task force

Jim:
raises hand Question Wont that interfere with your other task forces

Dwight:
Answer No because this is being given priority one This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot And I know I know what youre thinking Pam nods Wont that just shed more light on the penises But that is a risk we have to take Pam You can draw kind of Why dont you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community

Pam:
Phallus

Pam:
I dont often miss Roy But I can tell you one thing I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy Because that would have been the asskicking of the year small laugh Especially if it had been Jim He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims Whoo I am I am saying a lot of things

Phyllis:
I didnt really get a good look

Pam:
Thats OK I dont feel like answering phones

Dwight:

Karen:
Dwight this memo that you distributed is insulting

Dwight:
Desperate times call for desperate measures

Pam:

Michael:
OK you know something Dwight We are not the terrorists Why dont you just take these women put em in a burlap sack and hit em with a stick Because thats what youre doing I celebrate these women They deserve the right to dress as they please If Pam wants to show more cleavage she should be able to I encourage that

Karen:
Look its really simple We just want you guys to treat us with respect

Michael:

Jim:
Wait a second how are you qualified for that

Michael:
Oh I dont know James Did I come from a woman Have I slept with a woman More than one

Dwight:

Michael:
That is not current

Dwight:
You know what Why doesnt Oscar run the meeting Hes a homosexual

Jim:

Dwight:
Those are collectible action figures and theyre worth more than your car

Michael:
You know what I am the expert I will conduct it I know the crap out of women

Michael:
I um would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter

Creed:
Are we still discussing this I say again what is the big deal

Michael:
Nobody likes to be flashed When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party I nearly vomited

Meredith:
I dont remember doing that

Angela:
What a surprise

Dwight:

Michael:
What are Shut it Shut Up OK so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny tall goddesses Well look around Are women like that No No they are not points to Pam Even the hot ones arent really that skinny So what does that say That says that you women are up against it And it is criminal Society doesnt care Society sucks I dont even consider myself a part of society FYI Because I am so angry over all of this

Andy:
If it were up to me you ladies would be the fashion models

Karen:

Michael:
No Im being misogynistic That is insane I am not being sexist

Karen:
That  its the same thing

Phyllis:

Michael:
Yes

Phyllis:
When I got my hair cut short you asked me if I was a lesbian

Karen:

Angela:

Pam:

Michael:
groans And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form

Karen:

Dwight:
Listen up  Come to the center of the room please  This holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwights face in the middle is a Schrute Buck  When you have done something good you will receive one Schrute Buck  One thousand Schrute Bucks equals an extra five minutes for lunch

Pam:

Dwight:
Excellent question Pam  1100th of a cent

Oscar:
So ten

Dwight:
Just zip your lid  Another announcement  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the groups time and patience with nonwork related ethnic celebrations and parades of softminded dogoodedness  No longer  No more meetings

Dwight:

Kevin:

Dwight:

Dwight:
We Dont you wanna earn Schrute Bucks

Stanley:
No  In fact Ill give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again

Dwight:

Stanley:
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns

Andy:

Michael:

Ryan:

Kelly:

David:
Where do you see yourself in ten years

Michael:
Well clears throat Ive actually done a lot of thinking about that  And in ten years I am living in a big house with my kids  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything that has like a beltloop attachment or in my ear like a gluetooth  And because its the future I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day

Michael:
Well I dont know what its gonna be called but my point is the future of this company is now  And the future is me

Phyllis:
Michael what happened

Michael:
Jan got fired  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend   But more than that I realized that I couldnt take a job that would take me away from this place  This is where I belong  This is my home  And home is where the hardest

Michael:
Heart is  That makes a lot more sense  You think theyd help each other out like that at corporate Oscar shrugs I think not

Kelly:
Well if Michael gets the job I will be so upset because Dwight used to have a crush on me so if hes boss itll be really awkward

Pam:
Mmmhmm nods

Kelly:
But if Jim gets it you should be happy because you have a crush on him and he totally doesnt feel the same way and then hell be gone

Pam:
Yeah well you know whatever happens Kelly puts her hand on Pams shoulder Oh

Pam:
Oh I know  We talked about it and he told me

Kelly:
No seriously Pam wake up

Pam:
Okay

Pam:
Kelly made me realize something  She and I have nothing in common  And I need more friends

Dwight:
Define scorched earth policy

Andy:

Michael:
New York real estate  I started by looking for a brownstone like the Huxtables had shakes head but instead I found this very very nice place in Jamaica Queens mon  It is on the last stop of the subway which is wonderful because if I fall asleep I still end up at home  It is a suhweeeet one bedroom  I have a roommate uh Vijay Chokalingham hes a sophomore at Queens College  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment so free food and the place always smells like curry  So winwin

Michael:
Ok well I did not get the job in New York but I got the real prize domestic bliss Jan made me breakfast this morning well she bought the milk Its soy walks into bedroom Jan sleeping on bed This is why I do it thats what I have to come home to sighs She probably wont be up for a few hours

IT Tech Guy:

Pam:
A celebrity sex tape

Jim:
Really what kind of celebrity

Pam:
Not relevant

Kevin:

Ryan:

Michael:

Michael:
No I was being negligent But shes in the hospital shes fine recovering nicely Tiny little crack in her pelvis But she will be up in

Ryan:

Michael:
Yes It was on company property with company property so double jeopardy we are fine

Ryan:
I dont think you understand how jeopardy works

Ryan:

Ryan:
People keep calling me a Wunderkind I dont even know what that means I mean I know what it means it means very successful for your age so I guess it makes sense but its a weird word

Angela:
I have to visit the alchy

Dwight:
Check to see if shes faking If a car hit me it wouldnt crack my pelvis You know what I bet she cracked it at home Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp

Angela:
I wouldnt put it past her

Dwight:
So what do you need me to do

Angela:
I wrote it out

Dwight:
Mmhmm

Angela:
Theres a diabetes shot roll the insulin in your hand dont shake it She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she wont see it because of the cataracts Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine um and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after shes eaten And oh and theres a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail so youre gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail

Michael:
Ok I have an announcement

Michael:
No

Michael:
No That is not funny I love my employees even thought I hit one of you with my car For which I take full responsibility Look Im just trying to take everybodys mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and onto more positive things So I thought we should plant a tree

Michael:
Oh OK Wait up wait up guys guys guys hold on a second You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun Is if you forgave me in front of everybody

Meredith:

Michael:
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness Forgiveness is next to Godliness

Angela:
No thats not Thats next to cleanliness

Meredith:
You cracked my pelvis

Michael:

Meredith:
Youre not forgiven

Michael:
Come on starts to climb onto the bed with meredith

Pam:

Meredith:

Oscar:

Angela:
Sprinkles never hurt a soul God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this She wasnt ready She had so much left to accomplish

Dwight:

Dwight:
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat

Oscar:

Michael:
Dwight you havent seen Meredith yet have you

Dwight:
I do not respect her but I will go

Michael:
Alright I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs

Toby:

Satan is a master of lies Everything he says is the opposite

Michael:
Thank you for the permission Psych Alright lets just go around the room and tell me what you believe in

Stanley:

Darryl:

Dwight:
As a farmer I know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery With the electricity were using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days You tell me whats unethical

Intern:
How are you doing Ms Palmer

Meredith:
Better

Intern:
Excellent

Dwight:
Are you a doctor or a male nurse

Dwight:
Pfft Her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for one

Intern:
Ah so uh so that is where her uterus went Um Ms Palmer your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago

Meredith:
Yes Dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head

Dwight:
Just doing my job

Meredith:
And a rat Separate occasions

Michael:
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car sighs And its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case Doesnt make any sense God is dead

Michael:
Maybe believing in God was the mistake What did people believe in before The sun Maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too Like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat Or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine

Jim:
I will do some research

Pam:
I can help you with that

Dwight:
So just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine

Michael:
Oh God Rabies

Dwight:
Mmhmm

Michael:
I was in the hospital room with her How contagious is that is that like an STD

Dwight:
No no Youve gotta be bitten by something

Dwight:
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in Lock jaw

Michael:
walks out into the office I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Merediths life by hitting her with my car But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it

Jim:
Six of one really

Michael:
Is there a God If not what are all the churches for And who is Jesus dad

Pam:
Pams car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road I told you Im not dating anyone And even if I was I dont think its anyones business I mean when I do fall in love like when its for real the last person Im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew or my coworkers Jim gets into the passenger side Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be Jim leans over and kisses Pam Trust me when I fall in love youll know

Michael:

Kevin:
I just dont want to run I didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes

Michael:
Well youre going to have to run or youre going to be in a lot of trouble It is not olden times anymore

Andy:

Not well A doctor wont come out to collect a check for 70000 or 50000 if we go with the giant check

Jim:
Which we are

Pam:
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor

Michael:

Michael:
Finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit well today I had a triumph of the human body Thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end My guts and my heart and while I eventually puked my guts out I never puked my heart out And Im very very proud of that

Meredith:
Hey Michael

Michael:
Hey Mer How ya doing

Meredith:
Better

Michael:
Its ironic isnt it I mean Im in the hospital for not getting enough water and youre in it for a disease that causes the fear of water

Meredith:
Im in because you hit me with your car But I wanted to say I heard you were trying really hard so Im not mad at you anymore

Michael:

Pam:

Michael:
You know what why dont go around the room and say one memory of Meredith  Ill start  I liked her jumpers  They reminded me of Kindergarten  Jim

Kevin:
Ill always remember Merediths back  Thats all I can see from my desk  All that red hair over a nice strong back  Sometimes I pretend its Carrot Top and hes going to turn around and tell a joke

Andy:
So hows the view old girl  looking out windows  Oh  Theres a cemetery  You think thats affiliated with the hospital or is it a like a separate feature

Michael:
Hey Okay okay okay    You can just close that

Angela:
Bye Meredith  Here you go  We got you some balloons

Meredith:
See you guys chorus of goodbyes all but Michael file out as hes talking Creed takes Merediths pills

Michael:

Michael:
We have to have done something wrong

Dwight:
Mmm  nods

Oscar:
I was raised Catholic but Im agnostic now so I guess Im a secular humanist

Michael:
Oh  Great  We have a secular humanist here that is disgusting

Oscar:
Michael do you know what secular humanism is

Michael:
Yes  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition

Oscar:
Oh

Michael:
Stupid

Dwight:
My cousin Moses best friend was a dog  One day he was foaming at the mouth so I had to shoot him dead  Turns out he had only eaten one of Moses cream pies  Did I feel bad for killing him  No  Thats how you deal with a thief

Michael:
Yeah the uh the charitys having some financial problems  What do I look like to you Paul Newman  Thats actually not a good example because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman my eyes and my face  And I make my own salad dressing  I mix Newmans Ranch with Newmans Italian  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss  I could make I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone shakes head but I wont do it

Toby:
Yes uh some people in the office have complained

Toby:

Michael:
Is this about me and Jan In my office Because I will have you know that that was consensual What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here I dont think I dont think anyone heard anything We were very discreet and and most people had left by that point So I dont think its any of your business What I think you should do is roll up the memo real tight

Ageism Companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck your old boss threatened us with a lawsuit so we had to back off

Ryan:
OK This is

Michael:
Still my office Ryan Ryan sits down Well there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today Well new ideas are fine but they are also illegal because they are a form of ageism What Yes I am right Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older I did

Toby:
Technically hes right

Michael:
Hey shut up Toby Look why do we as a society hate old people so much

Creed:
Because theyre lame

Michael:
No Creed no they are not In fact many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability Like the old lady from Titanic points to her picture on the wall Or the funny things that they can do like wheres the Beef points to another picture on wall Jim raises his hand Yeah

Jim:

Ryan thinks that technology is the answer Well guess what I just drove my car into a lake

Oscar:
You did what

Michael:
I drove my car into a bleep lake Why you may ask did I do this Well because of a machine A machine told me to drive into a lake And I did it I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology and look where it got me

Jim:

Ryan:
No You cant imagine it though  The energy when youre actually there  Youre just part of something bigger than you thats moving faster than you  Your dreams are  it just everything feels so limitless

Ryan:
No  It eh you cant its not about how it sounds

Michael:

Jim:
That was slightly harsh dont you think

Ryan:
I spent three years driving around getting him yams and magic wands  He can get me water

Michael:
I think I know whats going on  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special boss water that he gets to drink now  And there isnt  But um dont tell him  Dont tell him that  I dont want to jeopardize our friendship

Michael:
Ryan is causing some problems  And you were always good at handling him  What should I do to control him

Kelly:
Well hes superticklish I dont know if that helps

Michael:
I know I know no what something else

Kelly:
Oh hes also superinsecure about his height

Michael:
Uhhuh

Kelly:
And he doesnt care about anybody but himself

Michael:
Good

Kelly:
And dont have sex with him cause if you do the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time

Michael:
My generations all about hard work and accomplishment  Like the moon landing  Or Vietnam  Rolling Stones  Greatest band ever

Oscar:
Youre fortythree  Mick Jaggers like sixtyfive

Pam:
Jan called and asked where youre going to meet for dinner  She wants you to call her

Michael:

Jim:
As opposed to

Dwight:
Printing press  Tractor  Mechanical thresher  Telephone  Airplane  The only inventions that matter

Jim:
What about cars

Dwight:
They fall under the category of airplanes

Jim:
They do  So cars are flightless airplanes

Michael:
Pizza by Alfredo

All:
shouts of disapproval

Michael:
Okay okay whats better  A medium amount of good pizza  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza

All:
Medium amount of good pizza

Michael:
sighs walks back into office

Kevin:
Oh no its bad  Its real bad  Its like eating a hot circle of garbage

Phyllis:
You can pick one of these things  Its unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this

Angela:
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do

Phyllis:
Balls up postits and throws them in Angelas face

Angela:
Ow

Phyllis:
That seemed to shut her up

Andy:
Are you looking for dinner and a movie  Because youre not going to find it in that box  Camera pans to Kevin giving an are you kidding me look

Pizza guy:
I dont care what you told them on the phone thats our policy

Michael:
You didnt actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza

Michael:
Okay it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon and if its policy it should say it on the coupon

Michael:
sarcastic shrugging of shoulders What do you mean hmmum

Pizza guy:
Not my problem

Michael:
It is your problem  Thats no way to do business okay I ordered eight pizzas with a halfoff coupon so I would like eight pizzas for halfoff  End of story

Michael:

Michael:
No no youre not going anywhere  Youre staying here until we figure this out

Pizza guy:

Michael:
Not a native speaker

Kevin:
I know whats right but Im not gonna say because youre all jerks who didnt come see my band last night

Ryan:
Do you really know which one is correct

Kevin:
I dont know

Pam:
Its whom when its the object of a sentence and who when its the subject

Phyllis:

Well it sounds right but is it

Stanley:

As an object

Kelly:
Ryan used me an object

Stanley:
Is he right about that

Pam:
How did he use it again

Michael:
Thank you

Toby:
To whomever meaning us the indirect object Which is the correct usage of the word

Michael:
Ive never done this before Ive never quit anything in my life  So you are filming history

Michael:
Nick I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company

Mr. Figaro:
Lipophedrine

Mr. Figaro:
Never heard of it

Michael:
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully and I loved it and everybody loved me  But the truth is I cant do this

Mr. Figaro:
Are you quitting

Michael:
I am

Mr. Figaro:
Come back anytime dont forget to disinfect your headset

Michael:
I was never in this for the money  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me  I tried to live the dream  I tried to have a job a girlfriend another job and I failed  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep and try it all again the next night

Andy:
So

Pam:
Youre being gross

Andy:
Not from a male perspective  You need to set me up with her I know she told you that shes looking and shes totally not responding to my moves

Pam:
What moves

Andy:
I have moonwalked past accounting like ten times

Pam:
I cant believe thats not working

Pam:
Um I dont know if I really see you two together

Pam:
Shes very religious

Andy:
Okay well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses

Andy:
Yeah and I punched a hole in a wall

Pam:
Thats right you did

Andy:
Yeah

Pam:
Now that I think about it Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple  But I couldnt do that to Dwight or Angela or Andy

Michael:
Hey Kevin youre a gambler right  A rounder you play the ponies small horses

Kevin:
I do gamble Michael

Michael:
Yeah I was thinking about doing some gambling myself  You know just a little bit of money  Maybe doubling it and them doubling it seven more times  I dont know kind of just for fun  I was thinking do you have tips or ideas about sure things  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight you know like like hes tied into some crooked dealings maybe his kid is sick or something  Like who do I call about that

Kevin:
The mob

Michael:
Do you know anybody in the mob

Kevin:
shakes head no

Michael:
Okay um Oscar Im going to need to take another advance on my salary

Darryl:
My daughter

Kelly:
Okay I see how it is pushes a stack of files onto the floor Oops

Kelly:
makes a W then an L with her fingers and then runs a finger across her throat

Phyllis:
Hes always been terrible with money

Stanley:
I bet its Jan spending him straight to the poor house

Kevin:
Yeah women be shoppin

Meredith:
I cant believe he has a second job

Oscar:
Hes not even good at his first one

Michael:
Hey guys

Kevin:
Shh

Michael:
Whatcha talking about  camera pans to each face in the break room  Okay I know whats going on  Youre talking about Jim and Pam if theyre having sex what it looks like I know I think

Pam:
Michael

Michael:
Hey hey hey

Oscar:
You heard me correctly

Michael:
Oh I hate monkeys

Pam:
Whats going on why do you have a second job

Michael:
I dont have a second job  Maybe Im having an affair with Suzanne Summers

Pam:
Doesnt Jan have money

Michael:
I dont talk to my girlfriend about money  It is rude and unsexual

Kevin:
True its best to hide our money problems from women

Michael:
I totally agree with you  But I dont have money problems I dont  Alright you know what  Watch this if I had money problems would I do this Michael holds up a bill crumples it up puts it back in his pocket

Oscar and Stanley:
You just put it back in your pocket

Darryl:
Hey lets call this what it is

Darryl:
Its like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around  Its gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door

Kelly:
Well I just need to know where this is going

Darryl:
Hey I like you  Oh yeah whats not to like  But you need to access your uncrazy side otherwise maybe this things run its course

Kelly:
Dont you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben you are the most selfish person Ive ever met in my entire

Darryl:
Slow down think it over

Kelly:
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that Ive ever met  I mean who says exactly what theyre thinking  What kind of game is that

Creed:
Hey cuz heard youre having money problems

Creed:
Listen Ive got the answer  You declare bankruptcy all your problems go away

Creed:
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider

Michael:
How would that help Creed  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt you lose

Creed:
You dont go by Monopoly man that game is nuts  Nobody just picks up get out of jail free cards those things cost thousands

Michael:
That is a good point

Creed:
Bankruptcy Michael is natures doover  Its a fresh start its a clean slate

Michael:
Like the witness protection program

Creed:
Exactly

Oscar:
Not at all

Michael:
Ive always wanted to be in the witness protection program  Fresh start no debts no baggage  Ive already got my name picked out Lord Rupert Everton  Im a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs  Thats the life

Michael:
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY

Oscar:
Hey I just wanted you to know that you cant just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen

Michael:
I didnt say it I declared it

Oscar:
Still thats not anything

Oscar:
This is a lot of credit card debt

Michael:
Yeah tell me about it

Oscar:
Mmm

Michael:
You know Jan has my credit cards and shes using them as if Im made of money she thinks Im a human ATM machine

Oscar:
Okay a hundred and twentyfive dollars Amazon

Michael:
Oh thats the Muppet Show on DVD classic

Michael:
That is by far the best way to strengthen your core  This machine you sit on a stabilizer ball you put your feet into the power stirups you reach up and you grab onto the super rod and you twist and you twist and you twist  It strengthens your entire core  Your back core your arm core the Marine Core actually uses it  I think thats how they got a core

Andy:
I left a little present for Angela  I think shes going to like it because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her that they were destined to be together  I got game

Oscar:
Okay the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need like a car and a house

Michael:
Mmhm  That is so cool how you have my name at the top

Oscar:
The red bar is what you spend on nonessentials like magazines entertainment things like that

Michael:
Right

Oscar:
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever ever needs like multiple magic sets professional bass fishing equipment

Michael:
How do they do this so fast  Is this powerpoint

Pam:
Man Angela really had a hold on him Dwight playing the recorder in the background  Angela

Michael:
No no we are going to leave Jan out of this

Oscar:
She has to know

Michael:
We will find another way well ask powerpoint

Oscar:
Michael this is a presentation tool

Oscar:
Im done

Michael:
No youre not Ok just youre not a tool Look well tell her that its bad but it couldve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half

Oscar:
Jan is smart

Michael:
She poses

Jim:
Dwight hows the hotel business

Dwight:
Stupid

Jim:
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently

Dwight:

Jim:
Maybe you should

Dwight:

Pam:
We wrote a good review  Under comments we wrote the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times

Jim:
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings

Pam:
Table making never seemed so possible

Dwight:
Im glad you enjoyed your stay

Pam:
We really did  It was fun

Oscar:
So due to Michaels clever financial maneuvering he finds himself tremendously in debt

Jan:

Michael:
Um thats how did you get that from what Oscars saying

Jan:

Angela:

Pam:

Jim:
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton

Dwight:
incoherent mumbling No you didnt

Dwight:
Mmmuhmm incoherent mumbling

Jim:
Yeah I mean she was with Roy and uh I just couldnt take it  I mean I lost it Dwight  I couldnt sleep I couldnt concentrate on anything  Even weird stuff like food had no taste  So my solution was to move away  It was awful  It was something that I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy and that includes you

Dwight:
sobbing reaches out to Jim after he walked away

Pam:
Hey I was thinking about dinner Jim grabs her face and kisses her

Jim:
Ah dinner  Lets see maybe we should try the new Italian place where the drivein used to be

Pam:

Jan:

Jan:
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease  Your debt follows you around the world electronically

Michael:
Ill stay off the grid

Jan:
Uh Michael come on come on you can deal with this  Its not that bad

Michael:
Yeah it is it is  I really messed up

Jan:
Well when my life fell apart and they and they screwed me in New York and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me I didnt have anyone  I mean my whole family still wont even talk to me on the advice of counsel and my friends were just waiting for this to happen

Michael:
Thats really nice of you to say

Jan:
Michael no what I want to say is you were there for me  By my side  Without even a thought  Thats just who you are  I mean no matter how badly I treat you or what Im going through you just you are there for me  And that is a guy worth staying beside  So wheres this train taking us

Michael:
I think the engineer left

Michael:

Jan:

Michael:
Thats nice though

Jan:
Its kind of painful and my nipples are oversensitive now

Michael:
It looks cute though

Michael:
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time  They would say things like dont pay for six months or you can transfer your account from another card

Michael:
Do you think Ill get any new ones  I could pause eventually looks up at Dwight

Dwight:

Andy:

Jim:

Dwight:
Second Life is not a game It is a multiuser virtual environment It doesnt have points or scores it doesnt have winners or losers

Jim:

Michael:

Michael:
Hey everybody I just got off the phone with David Wallace and he has given us the goahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial  Huh

Everyone:
applause

Michael:
I cant hear you less applause  Heard you a little bit less that time  Must be

Michael:
Okay okay  Who could do music

Pam:
How about Darryl

Michael:
Actually Im a little concerned about having a black person do the music because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a celestine prophesy and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano

Jim:
Michael is on a mission to prove that hes creative  Which I think is odd because Michael actually might be the most creative person Ive ever known  Every day Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before

Rolando:
on phone Dunder Mifflin this is Rolando  Oh yes shes been expecting your call knocks on door

Karen:
Yeah

Karen:
Thanks Ro  Hey we finally connected  Hows Scranton

Karen:
I am the regional manager of DunderMifflin Utica branch  Turns out its a pretty easy gig when your boss isnt an idiot and your boyfriends not in love with somebody else

Michael:
This is perfect

Dwight:
He looks like your twin

Michael:
But you will not tell anyone

Dwight:
I wont need to because well be together playing hooky  Yeah

Stanley:
I dont understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here

Michael:
Just go out and come back in

Stanley:
I got an offer from Utica for more money and Im going to take it

Michael:
What

Michael:
Hey everyone can I have your attention please  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there

Michael:
No no no no nono no no  You completely misinterpreted my tone this is a horrible thing  Clearly Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her

Jim:
Oh I dont think that is whats happening

Michael:
Okay smarty pants then why  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us

Stanley:
I think its because of my sales record

Michael:
That could not possibly be it

Michael:
How can I get you to stay

Stanley:

Michael:
Yeah we all want money  But there is none in the budget so Tell me why youre really leaving

Stanley:

Jim:
Shut up you shut up  This is the dumbest thing weve ever done

Pam:
I think its interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion Kevin dumping change in the snack machine And that also brought up themes of uh you know fate and coincidence  And Lucys torn between these two things  Shes torn between passion and convention

Kevin:
Damn it

Pam:
It just Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times I thought was uh

Kevin:
Damn it banging machine

Pam:
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer

Karen:

Dwight:
Listen lady you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people

Karen:
Im taking Stanley

Dwight:
Then we will burn Utica to the ground

Michael:
whispers Dwight  Granted maybe this was not the best idea but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanleys head we will burn Utica to the ground they get up to leave

Karen:

Toby:

Angela:
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee  Renegade clubs are dangerous  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group  They didnt need to gather  It was just gross

Meredith:

Dwight:

Dwight:

Phyllis:

Phyllis:
Michael wasnt invited on Ryans camping trip Toby went but Michael didnt go He wasnt invited

Pam:

Toby:
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat It was this amazing beautiful experience Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside

Michael:

Michael:
Hypothetically if I were to ask you to go camping and you know what hypothetical means Jim makes a face Not real

Jim:
Got it

Michael:
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me would you go

Jim:
Absolutely yes

Jim:
When Michael plays the hypothetical game I always say yes

Michael:
Really

Jim:
Yeah

Michael:
Oh you wanna go today

Jim:
And I am always busy

Jim:
Oh cant go today cause Im donating blood

Michael:
How often can you actually donate blood

Jim:
Is there a limit

Michael:
Your body only has a certain amount

Jim:
Well is that it Or

Michael:
Yeah just this whole Toby camping thing uh seems a little lame

Jim:
How so

Jim:
Whats that

Jim:
Right

Michael:
In the wilderness Its not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents Its one guy or two guys if your plans change

Michael:
I wanna do it myself You know I want to go and and find out something about myself I wanna get outta here All the cliques and the office politics Fluorescent lights Asbestos

Jim:
I thought we had that looked at

Michael:
When Jan and I had satellite we used to watch a reality show called Survivorman And it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed

Michael:
OK I will only need two things Roll of duct tape and a knife

Dwight:
winks Im on it leaves room

Michael:
OK Thirty minutes or less please come back Save the receipts Dwight comes back with set of knives Hey what

Dwight:
Lets see if any of these will work clears the front of Michaels desk

Michael:
Hey hey hey Dwight Dwight rolls out an assortment knives Dwight

Michael:
Dwight and I are going out He will return later but I will not I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day

Michael:
No

Pam:
Great

Michael:
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness

Pam:
Oh

Michael:
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive The choice is yours

Jim:
Hmm no the choice is actually yours Are you sure you want to do this

Jim:
OK great

Michael:
This is a very personal private experience in the wild that I wish to share it with me myself and I

Jim:
Yup

Michael:
When I return I hope to be a completely changed human being

Jim:
Thatd be great

Dwight:
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment Lets put it this way no I do not

Michael:
This is what a true survivor man does You simulate a disaster like a plane wreck You could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets Now in this case this disaster is a serial killer Creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead

Dwight:
No I would never leave you for dead You would never escape

Michael:
Well yes I would And I would survive

Dwight:
I would make sure that you were dead

Dwight:
First I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified

Michael:
You

Dwight:
And they would call me the Overkill Killer

Dwight:
What are you doing

Michael:
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings Now this way I cant retrace my steps I dont know what streets weve been Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe Ow What are you doing

Dwight:
It would be better if you were unconscious

Michael:
No Gosh Dwight Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again Stop it stop it Stop it

Dwight:
Do you want to do this right or not

Michael:
Just please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life

Jim:
Oh wasnt it just someones birthday

Angela:
Yes Kellys was last week remember

Jim:
I do remember yeah

Angela:
Its birthday month Creeds is today Oscars is week after next Merediths is at the end of the month Jim exhales deeply Michael usually goes with red and white streamers

Jim:
You know what I have an idea Why dont we just do one big shared party

Angela:
What

Jim:
There are thirteen people working in this office so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast There are two types of toasts One is a joke about how old you are

Michael:
flashback to Stanleys birthday Look at those wrinkles Blacks do crack Not crack the drug

Jim:
And the other is something inappropriate Or horrible Or both What else He only sings the high harmony to Happy Birthday And hes a very big believer in surprise parties Maybe even arguably possibly to a fault

Michael:
flashback to Kellys birthday hiding in the elevator Happy Birthday

Kelly:
Ahhh drops the papers she was holding

Oscar:
Ahhh runs into door and Michael laughs

Michael:
flashback to Phyllis birthday sneaking up on Phyllis car Happy Birthday

Phyllis:
Oh Michael laughs

Jim:
We can just have one big fun party Everybodys happy nobody wastes their time

Angela:
I dont like it Angela leaves

Kelly:

Pam:
Okay

Michael:
Hi Michael sees Toby No no absolutely not What is he doing here

Diane:

Jan:
Michael just relax okay

Diane:
You know I think theyre uh ready for us now So

Michael:
Okay All right

Michael:
Yessh

Lester:
Mr Scott can you describe the circumstances of Ms Levinsons termination

Michael:
Well it was not just termination It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior

Lester:
Oh Very good Well put

Jan:
People underestimate Michael There are plenty of things that he is well above average at Like ice skating He is a very good ice skater

Pam:
Hey Kevin Jim needs to see you

Kevin:
About what

Pam:
He needs help balancing some travel receipts

Kevin:
Are you sure he wants me Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts

Pam:
Yeah no he asked for you specifically Hes in the conference room

Kevin:
enters conference room and sees ping pong table Oh awesome Pam puts Meeting in Progress sign on the door

Lester:
How long have you known the plaintiff

Michael:
I havent actually seen it But I have seen the firm and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief

Lester:
How long have you known Ms Levinson

Michael:
Six years and two months

Lester:
And you were directly under her the entire time

Michael:
Thats what she said

Lester:
Excuse me

Michael:
Thats what she said

Michael:
Uh whwhy would she say that

Diane:
No wait I dont understand Whos on record on saying this

Lester:
With all due respect Im in the middle of a line of questioning Now Mr Scott what did you say Ms Levinson said Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position

Michael:
Come again Thats what she said I dont know what youre talking about

Jan:
Okay if I may he was just telling a joke before so can we move on to another question

Jan:
Uh yes

Lester:
Can you go back to where this digression began

Deposition Reporter:
reading off paper Mr Schneider And you were directly under her the entire time Mr Scott Thats what she said

Michael:
Well delivery is all wrong Shes butchering it

Kelly:
Pam leaving bathroom Kelly entering awkward moment Pam steps aside to let Kelly in Yeah thats what I thought

Lester:
Did Ms Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired

Michael:
She thought it had to do with the twins Thats what I call them

Lester:
Can you be more specific Who are the twins

Michael:
Yes

Lester:
She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery

Michael:
Yes and frankly the timing was nothing short of predominant

Lester:
What about your romantic relationship with Ms Levinson Could that have played a part in her termination

Michael:
Well if it did then the company is breaking its own rules

Michael:
Because before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to HR And I have the proof right here makes a gasping sound

Diane:
Okay the company has just a few clarifying questions Mr Scott if thats okay with you

Michael:
I will allow it

Diane:
Um would you mind please just uh taking a quick look at uh this photograph please Diane hands Michael the photo of Jan and Michael in Jamaica

Michael:
Uh

Diane:
That is you and Ms Levinson in Jamaica is that correct

Michael:
Uhhuh

Diane:
And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship Does that sound right Mr Scott the timeline here is actually very important Please when did your relationship actually begin

Michael:
Ugh Well dedepends on how you define begin I mean if it was from the first time we shook hands thats like six years ago If its from the first time we kissed thats like two years ago

Diane:
Wait excuse me

Michael:
If it was the first time we kissed sober it was like four months after that

Diane:
No uh are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here

Michael:
Line

Diane:
Im sorry what

Deposition Reporter:
reading off paper Mr Scott do you realize you just contradicted yourself I did Yes you did Can I go to the bathroom No I really have to Ive been drinking lots of water You went five minutes ago That wasnt to go to the bathroom that was to get out of a question You still have to answer it First can I go to the bathroom No

Jim:
Good game Meredith

Dwight:
All right What is going on here

Jim:
Dwight Thank God youre here As it turns out one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master and I have to play him tomorrow or we lose the account Can you help me out Will you help me practice

Jim:
Dwight and Jim are playing pingpong and Dwight scores What the hell

Dwight:
I told you

Dwight:
All of my heroes are table tennis players Zoran Primorac JanOve Waldner Wang Tao Jrg Rokopf  and of course Ashraf Helmi I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba

Michael:
Jan and I had an off again on again relationship for two years And I know this destroys her case and I am sorry but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition

Lester:
Wait wed like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scotts personal journal

Lester:
This is plaintiffs exhibit 107 I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year Just got back from Jamaica Tan almost everywhere Jan almost everywhere Hehe Oh diary what a week I had sex with my boss I dont know if its going to go anywhere Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere that it was a one time mistake But we had sex six times so you tell me I am definitely feeling very eerie

Michael:
Irie

Lester:
Irie sorry More tomorrow xoxo Michael It would appear that neither you nor Ms Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word Is that correct

Michael:
I dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary

Diane Kelly:
Its basic discovery We have the right to review it

Man:
OK lets make ten copies of this diary

Toby:
Um can you make it eleven

Man:
Eleven sure And well break for lunch so everyone can have a look

Michael:
looking for a place to sit goes to Tobys table Can I sit here

Michael:
How can you give up my diary like that

Jan:
I had to Im sorry but I need to win this We need to win this

Jan:
You keep it under my side of the mattress

Michael:
I dont like lump Im really upset about this

Jan:
Alright I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company Lets call it even

Michael:
Fine I love you

Jan:
I love you too

Diane Kelly:
looking at a copy of Michaels diary Mr Scott who is this other woman Ryan Who you refer to her as Just as hot as Jan but in a different way

Michael:
Not a woman just a cool great looking best friend

Toby:
laughs out loud Excuse me

Michael:
Alright alright This is the way I see it Yes I had sex with Jan and yes I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend However Jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend So her actions are completely rightful

Michael:
Thank you very much You didnt have to say that

Diane Kelly:
Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews

Diane Kelly:
Mr Scott this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review Would you mind uh reading the date on that please slides the performance review towards Michael

Michael:
March 17th

Diane Kelly:
And that would be a month after your relationship became official is that correct

Michael:
Yes

Michael:
reading the performance review I am out of carrots I am out of sticks Mr Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee and a poor branch manager I recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales where he belongs

Diane Kelly:
Mr Scott after hearing that wouldnt you say Ms Levinsons judgment is at least very seriously flawed

Diane Kelly:
Mr Scott

Pam:
walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing pingpong Hows it going

Dwight:
Well he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable

Jim:
Check this out though spin serve serves and Dwight scores Well it works like 80 of the time so

Pam:
Nice So should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now

Dwight:

Lester:

Jan:
Michael I am not the enemy OK Dunder Mifflin is the enemy

Jan:
Alright wait Before you go any further let me show you what kind of loyalty they have OK Lester please read that part of Wallaces deposition

Lester:
Starting at paragraph 6 Council Mr Wallace regarding Michael Scott was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson David Wallace Yes

Michael:

Jan:

Dwight:
Michaels dinner party is for couples only which is why I wasnt initially invited  But that was then  I very recently entered into a serious monogamous relationship  looking around If that idiot ever gets here

Jan:
So this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia and then suddenly all the boys start paying attention to me  And it was funny because you know I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me  You know Jan wow you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia  laughs  Ah so that is why I uh wait Pam what was your what was your question

Michael:
Its been a rough couple of weeks

Jan:
I did and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep

Michael:
So shes passed out and some kids spraypaint a swear word on the neighbors dog

Jan:
Yeah

Michael:
And the neighbors blamed Jan

Jan:
Yeah  But you know it was my fault

Michael:
Its like you know the dog shouldnt have been outside in the first place  Anyway its a tragedy really because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds

Jan:
Mmhmm

So

Jan:
Yeah

Michael:

Pam:
to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog Did you pick a new chair Its been awhile

Michael:
Pam when I first opened this catalog I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair

Pam:
But instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair

Pam:
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago And normally I wouldnt care but he promised me his old one Its way better Its one of these makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down I really want it

Michael:
holding up the catalog Have you ever seen this woman

Pam:
Her

Michael:
Hmm

Pam:
Or in a great chair

Michael:
Oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women

Pam:
I definitely remember your dinner party

Michael:
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman whispers Jan I think that fate put this catalog in my hands

Pam:
Actually I put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair

Michael:
What is it like being single I like it I like starting each day with a sense of possibility And Im optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results

Oscar:

Michael:

Michael:
starts to cry I dont understand why you keep picking on me

Stanley:
Oh for the love of God

Michael:
You just do and I dont know why so please help me understand

Stanley:
Fine Here it is you are a person I do not respect The things you say your actions your methods and style Everything you would do I would do it the opposite way

Michael:
Well Stanley maybe youre feeling that you dont respect me because you dont know me very well

Stanley:
Michael I have known you a very long time and the more Ive gotten to know you the less Ive come to respect you Any other theories

Michael:
All right you dont respect me I accept that But listen to me you cant talk to me that way in this office you just cant I am your boss Cant allow it

Stanley:
Fair enough

Michael:
I am good person and sometimes good people dont get no respect Rodney Dangerfield as Rodney Dangerfield Hey I dont get no respect No respect at all When I was in the sandbox as a kid I got not respect My wife likes to talk after sex so she called me from a hotel room and said I dont respect you Ahh thoughtless Aw you know what dont get no respect Airplane food Why dont they just make the plane out of the airline food My wife dont get no respect sometake her please for example as Jeff Foxworthy If you dont get no respect you might be redneck as Borat Respect is niiice Borat as Rodney Dangerfield Whats the deal with Grapenuts No grapes no nuts I dont get no respect

Michael:
So Im thinking as a reward for our loyal clients that we contact their assistants and we find out where they live And then we go to their houses in the middle of the summer and go caroling It is a summer Christmas saleabration And we call it a summer salesalot Feedback Anybody Stanley

Stanley:
Has potential to be your best idea yet Michael smiles

Michael:
Its complicated Pam  I mean the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk

Jim:
Well I actually agree with her I think you should talk to him  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash

Kelly:

Michael:
Finally  Right  Ok Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams  Why dont you have a seat  Phyllis sits Lets all clap at Phyllis everyone claps Ok  in Michael Clump voice  When Michael Clump wants to remind you normal voice that corporate their idea yes was to urge you to lose weight but more importantly what this whole thing is about this contest is really about being healthy  And in order to be healthy you have to eat Kelly  Kelly  kneels down in front of Kelly Dwight tries to help him down Michael shouts gibberish at him  Kelly I want you to stand up on your chair  Come on stand up on your chair  Stand up stand up stand up  Somebody help her  Here we go Kelly stands up on her chair Ok I want you to look at her  Shes a beautiful Indian woman  Why  What makes her beautiful

Creed:

Holly:
Pencils down Dwight quickly puts his pencil down Just kidding take your time

Holly:
Today is ethics day  After they finish their quiz Im going to run my first ethics meeting here  Its gonna be insaaaaane  No its not  I have to read from the binder

Dwight:
trying to assist Michael who is trying to press play on a CD player I got it I got it Olivia NewtonJohns Lets Get Physical starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room dancing

Michael & Holly:
Lets get ethical  Ethical  I wanna get ethical  Lets get into Ethics yeah  Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk  Your body talk  Let me hear your body talk

Michael:
WOO  Alright

Michael:
Why are you helping her  Youre not even dating  Shes my friend and ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship without her even knowing Uh

Michael:
Ok lets give it for Miss Holly Flaaaax everyone claps

Holly:
Thanks Michael Michael groans exhaustingly Today were going to have a business ethics seminar because recently without mentioning any names there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired

Michael:
clapping Ok  Well done  Good speech Ryan youre a good guy

Holly:
Lets start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours Now some of you marked that you very strongly agree  But ideally you would have selected totally agree

Phyllis:
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree

Holly:
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement

Holly:
Thank you  In fact spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing

Kelly:
What

Holly:
Yes its called time theft and its the same as taking money from the company  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters

Stanley:
This meeting

Andy:
Heyoh

Dwight:
Yes

Kelly:
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour then Ill just take up smoking  Ill do it  I dont care

Meredith:
Ill smoke with you  I got a bag of cigars in my purse

Holly:
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about

Michael:
Can we have a moment  whispering Can I talk to you for a sec  Lot of good stuff And you look you look fantastic

Dight:
Michael

Michael:
Yeah

Dwight:
What should we be working on while you guys are talking

Michael:
Do some do some work whispering to Holly People expect a lot from these meetings  Laughter sudden twists  Surprise endings  You need to be Robin Williams and M Night Shyamalan  You need to be Robin Shyamalan

Holly:
Well I just have to get through the binder

Michael:
Do you just youre kind of losing them

Holly:
I am

Micheal:
Yeah dont think about the stakes  Itll freak you out

Holly:
Ok to everyone Michael makes a really good point so uh lets just open this up a little bit Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil  Thats not right

Michael:
coughs to hide his words Lauren coughs enough with the pencils

Holly:
No I have to go over pencils and office supplies  Its part of the ethics thing

Oscar:
That isnt ethics  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good  This is just the corporate antishoplifting rules

Andy:
Ill drop an ethics bomb on you  Would you steal bread to feed your family  Boom

Oscar:
Exactly Andy

Andy:
Yeah I took intro to philosophy

Dwight:
Its a trick question  The bread is poisoned  Also its not your real family  Youve been cuckolded by a stronger smarter male

Michael:
I would not steal the bread  And I would not let my family go hungry

Holly:
Ok but we should get back to business  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace

Michael:
Anybody  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions  Stanley  Oscar come on

Oscar:
Pass

Holly:
What was the dilemma

Oscar:
Ok once in a while Ill take a long lunch

Michael:
A siesta

Dwight:
Time thief  Time thief  Fire him

Jim:
Dwight youve really never stolen any company time

Dwight:
Never

Kelly:
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer

Michael:
Who hasnt  Good  Good  What else

Holly:
No I Id like to hear more about that

Angela:
I once reported Oscar to the INS  Turns out hes clean but Im glad I did it

Michael:
Well lets keep this party movin on

Meredith:
Ill go  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers the Scranton rep for Hammermill

Michael:
Bruuuuuuuuuce

Meredith:
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates

Jim:
Jackpot

Holly:
Meredith that is serious  I mean not only that a conflict of interests theres also an exchange of goods

Michael:
Thats crazy  Thats crazy talk  Meredith  The Merenator sleepin with suppliers  Hooooh  Wow  What time we got checks watch You know what  Thats a good place to end it  Right there  This I think was a great ethics seminar  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about  Right what is wrong  Whos to say  Really  In the end  I mean because it is unknowable  But lets give her a round of applause  Holly everybody  Holly  Get back to work everyone applauds then leaves to Holly Great job  I am truly impressed  That uh you really pulled that one out  Classic  Classic meeting  We should celebrate

Holly:
Michael there is some serious issues with Meredith

Holly:
I mean all of you have done things I wouldnt have done myself but Merediths actions are really over the line

Micheal:
Nnyeah  What ya gonna do

Holly:
So regarding this supplier approximately how many liaisons have there been

Meredith:
Liaisons you mean meetups  I dont know once a month for six years  Something like that

Michael:
Meredith why dont you tell Holly its not what she thinks  Nothing unethical happened and that you just like to sleep around

Holly:
No its not a formality  Now were these um meetups just personal  Unrelated to business

Meredith:
Nah I wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper  Theres not a lot of fruit in those looms

Micheal:
Ughh  For the love of God were trying to help you stupid bag

Holly:
What I dont understand is why the steak coupons  I mean if you were already getting the discounted paper

Meredith:
Well its funny  Maybe its a girl thing but after we did it and he would give me those coupons I just felt good about myself Holly begins to write in her notebook Hey whats going on here  I thought I had immunity

Meredith:
Well Im not quitting

Jim:
starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns stops it when Dwight is done Yawn  Four seconds

Dwight:
What are you doing

Jim:
Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so Im just making sure

Jim:
Personal conversation  Seventeen seconds

Jim:
stops the watch One second

Michael:
Well well  Holly lujah  Its a miracle youre at your desk

Holly:
Its Mikeraculous

Michael:
Hooooh  Reaching  Youll get there  Anyway I was giving it some thought and theres no reason that two attractive good looking intelligent funny attractive people cant you know just sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out

Holly:
Sounds good

Michael:
Good  Would you care to bang it out over lunch

Holly:
Oh I already bought this

Holly:
So Ive gone over corporate policy

Michael:
What do you think  What do you think of this place

Holly:
Oh its very nice

Holly:
Mmm

Michael:
Wow that sounds so warm

Holly:
In Summer

Michael:
Here too  You know what my favorite season is

Holly:
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first

Michael:
Yeah get the boring stuff out of the way  Autumn was what I was going to say  When the leaves change  Its just I I think it is the most contemplative of seasons

Holly:
Ok so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just dont think there is any way I can write a report that doesnt end with her being terminated

Holly:
Im from da future

Michael:
Yeah

Jim:
Hey Andy

Andy:
Yo

Jim:
By any chance did you see Battlestar Galactica last night

Andy:
No I did not  Was that any good

Jim:

Ok Dwight turns around but Jim holds up the stopwatch threatening to start it

Jim:
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff  You know like klingons and wookies and all that but Dwight begins to turn around again Jim holds up the watch Sorry was there something you wanted to add Dwight

Andy:
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica

Jim:
You know its weird  Its practically a shot for shot remake

Andy:
Really Dwight closes his eyes clutches the paper in his hands Huh thats cool

Jim:
Storys kinda bland  Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor

Andy:
Really  That doesnt sound right

Michael:
I just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance  I mean what sort of place is that to call home  And Meredith needs this job  This is her main source of money

Holly:
Well thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol  Those are the rules

Michael:
Ok new idea  We dont report it at all  We just punish her

Holly:
We punish her

Michael:
Mmhmm tell her she cant have sex for six months

Holly:
I dont think we could enforce that

Michael:
I dont know  I saw this thing like a belt with a key

Holly:
A chastity belt

Michael:
No its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of sometimes they are made of metal  You know what I am talking about  You unlock a little door that down where you where you put where you put the

Jim:
He has not stopped working for a second  At 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open which I always thought was impossible  At 132 he peed and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports  And on the flip side I have been so busy watching him that I havent even started work  Its exhausting being this vigilant  Ill probably have to go home early today

Michael:
I am just saying that I dont think that you understand what I am saying

Holly:
No you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet accept the discount on supplies not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened

Michael:
Yes

Holly:
What am I saying

Michael:
Well bleh busted  I dont

Holly:
Im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I dont think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated

Michael:
Well you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family

Holly:
Its not a family  Its a workplace

Michael:
I will be honest with you  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I dont want to take the elevator with her  And I am holding on to her leftovers throws Hollys leftovers in the trash

Jim:
Dwight walks back to his desk 19 minutes and 48 seconds  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds

Dwight:
None of your business

Jim:
So I guess I can assume that was personal

Dwight:
Dwight stares at Angela buttoning the top button of her blouse Fine

Jim:
So maybe youre not completely ethical after all

Dwight:
Yes maybe Im not Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera

Holly:
Its been a little tense  People are suspicious of me  And my best friend in the office wont even talk to me Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker  I was just hoping middle school was over

Michael:
Whats the only thing worse than one HR rep

Michael:
You get me

Holly:
Can I sit

Michael:
I dont know  Can you  Kendall my main man

Kendall:
on speakerphone Listen Holly Michael I just got the report that your branch submitted and theres a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with

Holly:
Yes that came out during the ethics seminar

Michael:
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar

Kendall:
Well Im not sure these circumstances warrant any action

Holly:
Oh I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical

Kendall:
Well from what I can gather it seems like a gray area  Look to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I dont know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that

Holly:
Umm Kendall I understand that the discount is good for the company but Im just not happy about the way we are getting it

Kendall:
I thought it was clear with you Holly  Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training

Holly:
No I understand

Kendall:
Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if its not something you can handle then thats a different discussion

Kendall:
Good

Michael:
How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply I told you so  Gently with a rose  In a funny way like its a hilarious joke  Or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse  Probably the funny way

Holly:
Can I have everyones attention  Excuse me may I have everyones attention please  We need to finish the ethics seminar

Andy:
No way lady

Kevin:
Its a trap

Holly:
Everyone please I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training

Michael:
Ok everybody listen up  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you

Meredith:
Am I getting fired

Michael:
Now is really not the time Meredith

Holly:
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers  Personal days on the other hand are much more flexible

Phyllis:
Thank you Meredith this was delicious

Meredith:
Hey where is the steak sauce

Kevin:
I think were out

Meredith:
I got some in my minivan somewhere

Andy:
Wait a second how does the steak factor in again

Kevin:
I think she got it as a tip but I dont know why she didnt just take cash

Phyllis:
I dont care what shes doing  I just hope she keeps doing it

Holly:
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about

Oscar:
Thats a big ethical area

Oscar:
Listen I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics  Why isnt the company doing better  Mmm it could be the pad of Postits I took home last week  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance  Im sure well cover both in the seminar

Creed:
Ive done some things Im not proud of  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam uh two years ago  Princess Cruise Lines

Phyllis:
During our honeymoon safari in Africa Bob and I were driving late at night and hed been drinking and suddenly thump  We hit something with our jeep  It was probably a man  We didnt know what to do  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us so we just kept driving as fast as we could  We bribed the airline got on a plane that night and fled home  Maybe it was just an ostrich  In a soccer uniform

Ryan:
Fraud Jim Fraud

Ryan:
Sure last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebodys car  I never said a thing

Kevin:
Wait what

Kevin:
You knocked the mirror off of my car

Ryan:
Yeah isnt that messed up

Kevin:
Yeah

Ryan:
That guy did a lot of things Im not proud of

Kevin:
Wait when you say that guy you mean you

Ryan:
Look I feel you okay  That guy took no responsibility for his actions

Kevin:
But are are you gonna pay for my mirror

Ryan:
If I have to answer for everything that guy did shakes head Im never gonna move on

Ryan:
Were never going to get what need from that guy still shaking head pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen

Ryan:
Hey anybody see a pair of sunglasses

Kevin:
Umm I think I saw some in the kitchen toaster oven bell rings Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he sees his melted sunglasses on the tray Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin Oh I didnt do that  That was Kevin 10 but he hurt a lot of people Ryan and I cant accept responsibility for what he did Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash Kevin smiles

Stanley:
About what

Meredith:
Holly  Shes on the warpath  She is gunning for all our jobs  Do you guys have any dirt on her

Meredith:
No  Something I can blackmail her with

Phyllis:
One time I said good morning to her and she didnt say it back

Meredith:
Stanley didnt she say a bunch of racist stuff to you

Meredith:
You werent even in the room  Thanks for nothing

Meredith:
Hey how did it go

Michael:
Oh cr oh God  Meredith you know what  I just need a minute okay

Phyllis:

Phyllis:

Andy:
Why would that make me a pervert I 

Angela:
Well it does  Thats me

Andy:
Thats mean come on thats  Angela storms out

Holly:
Ahoy

Michael:
Ahoy So how you doin

Michael:
Um listen  Jan Levinson is coming in today and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy  the child of which I have a vested interest  Its all kind of weird  Anyway she is incredibly fat and enormous right now  extremely unattractive  And you are on the other hand one of the more attractive people in the office  So while shes here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings  And Im treating Ryan the same way

Holly:
Of course Yeah

Stanley:
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace  Theyre always complaining  I have varicose veins too  I have swollen ankles Im constantly hungry  do you think my nipples dont get sore too  Do you think I dont need to know the fastest way to the hospital

Jim:
Jan enters the office pushing a stroller Jan

Jan:
Hi Jim

Jim:
What do we have here

Jim:
Really

Dwight:
Oh no Michael enters and notices Jans baby

Michael:
So this is Astird

Michael:
Oh OK  Why didnt you call me

Jan:
Well um you know labor just kind of started very suddenly and

Michael:
I could have helped

Jan:
And the birth instructor thought it wasnt a good idea for you to be there so

Jan:
OK you dont have any idea what Ive been through so lets

Michael:
No I dont

Jan:
Im sorry I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet

Michael:
Can I hold her

Jan:
Yes yes you can You know I think just leave her in the car seat Yeah

Michael:
cradling the car seat awkwardly All right OK

Michael:
I love babies I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day if possible because it nourishes me  It feeds my soul  Babies are drawn to me and I think its because they see me as one of them  But cooler and with my life put together a little bit  If a baby were president there would be no taxes there would be no war  There would be no government and things could get terrible  It actually probably  it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion

Michael:
carrying the car seat Ladies and gentlemen it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst

Jan:
trid

Michael:
trid Levinson  Hi  Astrid this is everybody look  This is your family  Youre going to know them for the rest of your life

Jan:

Michael:

Michael:

Im gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton

Jim:
Im gonna make a bigger leap here He is into you

Alex:
Why did you come to New York in the first place

Pam:
Because they have a great design program and I wanted to see if I was any good at it And I wanted to work on my art too

Alex:
Right And thats why I think that you should stay here Because I mean you  really you just got here you know You cant do New York in three months You know it has everything It has  all the opportunity is here All the  the whole art scene is in New York You know it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it

Pam:
Jims in Scranton

Alex:
I know But all Im saying is if theres even a teeny tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist then I think you should stay here because you dont want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been And that is the end of my speech I planned it all Anyway   I will see you tomorrow

Jim:
We should take a look at those surveys

Michael:
Why are surveys important Okay hypothetical A man wants to buy 500 reams ofcarrots And so hes like What do I do Where do I go Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier the insensitive carrot salesman Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot but guarantee nextday delivery on your carrots Most companies need their carrots the next day Now substitute paper for carrots and that is why surveys are important

Dwight:
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative

Phyllis:

Jim:
Ah You brought in your doll collection

Dwight:
These are not dolls Jim  These are commodities  Same as gold or oil

Dwight:
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season  This year its a doll Half girl half unicorn  Catchphrase My horn can pierce the sky  Pathetic I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit  Isnt that right princess makes doll nod

Oscar:
Do you know how to do an intervention

Michael:
An intervention  Its sort of hard to describe but really its its a coming together its a surprise party for people who are who have addictions  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves  And then they stop

Phyllis:
It looks like were going to be here for awhile so why dont you make a little plate of hummus for everyone  Little triangles of pita toasted on both sides fanned so you can easily can grab them

Michael:
Okay how do you feel

Meredith:
A little better I threw up

Toby:
Michael we are only allowed to talk about Merediths work performance We can not ask her to stop drinking

Michael:
I am not asking her to stop drinking  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic

Michael:
Yeah obviously you are Okay everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand everyone raises their hand

Dwight:
Aye

Meredith:
I dont care what everyone thinks  I know I am not an alcoholic

Michael:
Meredith have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind

Meredith:
Sure

Michael:
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday

Michael:
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church

Toby:

Michael:
Okay you know what Toby  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this  Im doing your job man  Hey are you texting

Kelly:

Michael:
Alcohol is a drag Yes  Heres what Id like to do  Id like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us  Ill begin  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this  Thats how your drinking affected me  Anybody else  Another time when Merediths drinking affected you   Come on people  If we dont say anything shes not going to get any better  Kevin raises his hand Yes Kevin

Phyllis:

Meredith:

Dwight:
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick

Dwight:
There are several ways to kill a zombie but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick

Michael:
Everyone in this room loves you but mark my words we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out

Dwight:

Dwight:
Store only has three employees

Michael:
So what

Michael:
Maybe they are shrinking

Dwight:

Michael:
They could be shrinking

Dwight:
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store No sign of the sign being moved

Michael:
Ah ha popping something in his mouth Yup

Dwight:
spying through binoculars Its lunch time and no sign of anyone coming in or out Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch

Michael:
Mm hmm 

Michael:
And there are clouds There are clouds in the sky which means gonna rain bad for business

Dwight:
Oh it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus

Michael:
Argh why are you all

Michael:
Shut up

Michael:
Ready to do this

Dwight:
Yeah

Michael:
Good Here come the sharks they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead

Michael:
In nature there is something called a food chain its where the shark eats a little shark And the little shark eats a littler shark And so on and so on Until you get down to the single cell shark So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business

Michael:
Hello

Entire Prince family:
Hello hi

Michael:
My name is Michael Scarn I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company

Prince Grandfather:
Oh please come in

Prince Grandfather:
What kind of business are you in

Michael:
We are a law firm

Prince Grandfather:
I assume your primary paper needs are stationary general office

Michael:
You know I will be honest with you about something Where we used to live our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didnt feel like a priority So I guess my question reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it for you would be reading off sheet how many clients do you have

Prince Grandfather:
About 80

Michael:
Really That many This doesnt seem like a very big operation

Prince Grandfather:
Its just me my wife and my son

Michael:
Ah so when did you set up shop

Prince Grandfather:
I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam

Michael:
Oh Vietnam I hear its lovely 

Prince Grandfather:
muted Mmhmm shrugs

Andy:
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments Topic Hillary Swank is attractive

Entire office:
Hot

Kevin:
The debate is whether she is hot

Stanley:
What difference does it make Attractive beautiful hot were talking about the same thing here

Kevin:
Huge difference A painting can be beautiful but I dont want to bang a painting

Michael:
So even specialty paper say 94 brightness doublebonded you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock

Michael:
Well that is because I am a genius

Prince Grandfather:
Oh really

Michael:
Yes well about some things and other things I am very stupid Like watch this Is this the cup picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion Is this the cup picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion Is this what I drink out of glug noise both laugh Laughter is my job tears are my game law is my profession

Dwight:

Michael:

Dwight:
Pshaw thats nothing Ive 90 clients myself You had better look out someone might run you out of business

Dwight:
Me too smirking

Jim:
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures you know We dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people

Kevin:
Are you serious Jim just show us a picture

Oscar:
Kevin cmon

Kelly:
Yeah shut up Kevin

Kevin:
Hes making all these fancy uh its a gut thing

Jim:
Kevin you know what why dont you close your eyes Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you in a more and more seductive voice and says Kevin Malone I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now And now you tell me something is she hot Kevin gets up to join the hot team to their great joy Does that end the debate

Kevin:
Kevin sits down gets right back up and heads back to not hot team No its is she hot not would you do her Respect the game

Angela:
Oh my God

Dwight:
My boss his insensitivity might border on cruel This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings Michael takes offense and charges over

David Wallace:
How could you possibly think this is a good idea

Michael:
Electricity

Dwight:
Shampoo

David Wallace:
You could have burned down the whole building

Dwight:
I just want to say for the record I did not kill anyone  Stanley was attacked by his own heart And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days

Lawyer:
Did you shout Fire causing a panic

Dwight:
Yes I shouted fire  I shouted many things I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what heeded

Michael:
Hed Hedded

Dwight:
When no one hedded

Michael:

Dwight:
Nno one would take hedded of my instructions

Michael:
Heed Heed

David Wallace:
No were not

Michael:
I am not a mind reader David

David:
Look this is very serious offense  We have cause to fire you

Michel:
Can you shove down  Instead shove down please  Instead what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer

Dwight:
No

Dwight:
PETA

David Wallace:
Michael you have to take responsibility here One of your employees had a heart attack  He could have died because of the way that you are allowing your office to run  Do you want that on your conscious

David Wallace:
Michael

David Wallace:

Dwight:
Well I guess we papered over that pretty nicely chuckles It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy highrise Whats the matter You hungry

Michael:
sighs No Dwight  I am worried  A mans life is in my hands

Dwight:
Dont you worry about that  I got it covered  Okay

Michael:

Dwight:

Michael:
Yes

Dwight:
Come on

Michael:
Im a smart guy  Ill figure it out

Dwight:
Thats preposterous

Michael:
No I will

Michael:
Nobody should have to go to work thinking Oh this is the place that I might die today  Thats what a hospital is for An office is for not dying  An office is a place to live life to the fullest to the max to An office is a place where dreams come true

Michael:
Shhh Dont excite him Dont make him excitable whispering Welcome back Stanley

Stanley:
Thank you Michael

Stanley:

Stanley:
flashback No way Uhuh

Stanley:

Stanley:
But the doctor said if I cant find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings Im going to die

Michael:
Andy

Andy:
in a British accent A throne for your highness

Stanley:
Im not sitting in a wheelchair

Michael:
No no no No debate You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet

Stanley:

CPR trainer:
ABC Okay  And hat stands for airway breathing and circulation

Michael:
Okay you know what That could be a little confusing because in sales ABC means always be closing

Dwight:
This is a farce I should be teaching this course

Michael:
Shut it  Shut it

Michael:
We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his when his heart went berserk And I knew exactly what to do but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it Red Cross you know racket

Kevin:
giving chest compressions to the practice dummy I cant keep doing this forever

CPR Trainer:
Its been 20 seconds

Kevin:
Call it

CPR Trainer:

Dwight:

Michael:
You know who I really think should go Stanley

Stanley:
Oh I dont know

Phyllis:
Thats not a good idea Michael

Michael:
Come on

Michael:
No rest for the sick We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working  What are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops

Stanley:
I would die

Michael:
And youre okay with that

Stanley:
Im okay with the logic of it

Michael:
Come on Stanley  Youre losing you  Youre losing you Do it

Angela:

Michael:
Okay okay  Ill show them Here we go whispers Stanley  All right

CPR Trainer:
So assessing the situation  Are they breathing

Michael:
Where are they  You know what If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them I mean what kind of quality of life do we have there

Kevin:
I would want to live with no legs

Michael:
How about no arms No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now Kevin You dont do anything

Rose:
All right well lets get back to it Cause youre losing him Okay too fast Everyone we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute 

Jim:
Hows that gonna help you

Michael:
I will divide and then count to it

Jim:

Rose:
Okay Well a good trick is to pump to the tune of Staying Alive by the Bee Gees  Do you know that song

Michael:
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can I think sounds have a lot to do with that Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds a couple of sounds play on the computer That one makes me think of death Its kinda nice

Michael:
everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand It is a beautiful sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful Now up ahead a castle in a distance

Pam:
What opens her eyes Michael is standing over her Oh

Michael:
And you walk up toward the castle and inside the castle are 4 men and each of them none of them have shoes and they give you a funny cigarette and you feel even more relaxed and then you want ice cream You want a big bowl of ice cream What kind do you want Shout it out

Meredith:

Pam:
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam Oh hey Mom No what did Dad say

Jim:
What

Pam:
After you talked he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment

Jim:
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce so it was her parents or my parents

Pam:
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me

Michael:
I dont get it Do I stress you out

Michael:
Oh

Michael:
Remember when people used to say boss when they were describing something that was really cool like those shoulder pads are really boss man Look at that perm that perm is so boss Its what made me want to become a boss And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads But now boss is just slang for jerk in charge

Michael:
Ok everybody Ive figured it out The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think Jim shakes his head at the camera You are keeping these feelings inside and that is whats causing stress So what is the solution Solution is honesty laughter and comedy In short

Michael:
What No No I am talking about a roast Of Michael Scott Oh cmon Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel Youve seen it right Everybody gets together and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy and everybodys laughing and everybodys hugging each other

Pam:
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam Uh Im sorry Michaels not here right now can I take a message Great I will Thanks

Dwight:
Its very unusual for Michael not to show up to work My guess Hes either deeply depressed or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them And I always say Michael take two steps back and stare at the icicle from the side And hes like no I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them

Kevin:

Jim:
You ok

Pam:
Yeah they hug

Pam:
When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates My kids are gonna be right about that I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them Andy is in the background looks incredulous

Dwight:

Just about everyone in this office is single right now   Including me  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain  Especially me because of my great capacity for emotion and it is my first Valentines Day since Holly so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces

Kelly:

Meredith:

Dwight:

Oscar:

Kelly:

Michael:

Four months ago I dated a woman named Holly and um this is actually the first time that Ive even considered getting back into that arena again  You know what sometimes its not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back but its about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all   Theres a lot of princesses out there  You know they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think I think my odds are pretty good

Stanley:

OK I think it might have been an inside consultant

David:
Was it the sales department

Michael:
Yes

David:
Was it Jim

Michael:
No

David:
OK was it Dwight

Michael:
long pause Yes

Dwight:
That was your idea

Michael:
same time as Dwight No I dont think I ever did That was your idea Dwight

Michael:
Im not taking Im not taking

Dwight:
Wasnt my idea Loved  but I cant

Michael:
Wait a second wait a second I wrote it down in my diary

Dwight:
You dont keep a diary

Dwight:
Hold that thought Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns flipping through diary March 4th Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year

Michael:
Why do you have a diary

Dwight:
To keep secrets from my computer

Michael:
OK you know what You came up with this idea I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up

Dwight:
Impossible

Michael:
Yes you did

Dwight:
I wasnt given candy as a child so a movie that fetishized it that much would have made no sense to me Plus we werent allowed to see movies So do the math

Dwight:
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasnt mine Discussed movies

Michael:
Would you like to go to lunch with me Just the two of us

Dwight:
With all my heart

Jim:
All Im saying is that its a first dates so just keep a respectful distance

Kevin:
Right

Jim:
No that is what I mean

Pam:
to Jim Shush to Kevin Kevin a playful touch on the arm or on the back it can show your interest and its really romantic

Kevin:
puts hand on Jims hand Like that

Jim:
No stop it

Andy:
Jim Andy and Pam all talking over each other turn into this black and carbon brickwhere this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that

Michael:
We think a lot alike Sometimes you will think something and I will say what youre thinking

Dwight:
OK what am I thinking right now

Michael:
Umm nacho chips

Dwight:
No How skin is the largest organ of the body

Michael:
Oh OK Let me just cut to the chase Dwight I want you to fall on your sword for me

Dwight:
Oh not gonna happen

Dwight:
I did fall on my sword once I was running with it in my belt Wont happen again

Michael:
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin I mean whats the point Youre cooped up in there all day You dont get to do your farming Youre not dating Angela anymore It doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea It doesnt matter Me on the other hand I would be lost without this place You way too manly

Dwight:
What about Shoe La La

Michael:
I have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called Shoe La La And its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or for just lounging around the house

Michael:
Yes they are you just dont care about the information

Michael:
He doesnt love it that much Wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired

Dwight:
Well

Dwight:
We discussed the fact that Im cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world

Michael:
Right

Dwight:
No plowing my own acres Going around shirtless all day You know experiencing freedom

Michael:
Thats it Thats it You cant put a price on freedom

Dwight:
Try me

Michael:
Thats why you made the decision Thats why you made

Dwight:
I havent made a decision yet

Michael:
You kind of have

Michael:
Yes

Jim:
You cannot take the fall for him

He said he would do the same for me

Jim:
He can do the same for you Right now By getting fired instead of you So what are you gonna do

Dwight:

David:
Thats too bad

David:
Hopefully nothing that cant be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology The head of Blue Cross just called They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies Congratulations Dwight holds out hand for handshake

Who would have thought that the thing that would save this company would be work And pancakes In the end this day definitely had its ups and downs I realize that we dont have the biggest office Which is a surprise because 165 square feet sounds like a lot But we have people with the biggest hearts And I think for a small company that is really flushing Someone went to the bathroom That is really whats important

Andy:
Literally every song is better a cappella Name a song

Dwight:
Cherry Pie Warrant

Andy:

Andy:

Andy:
Aw Way better a cappella

Michael:
Hup throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth

Pam:

Jim:
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela but then she was sleeping with Dwight for several years Wait no that cant be right

Jim:
Anyway now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love

Andy:
This is my solo stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar a cappella starts singing You Can Call Me Al

Pam:
Im confused Am I walking down the aisle to You Can Call Me Al

Andy:
Trust me You will not be walking You will be boogieing

Jim:
I am extremely interested So how much will all of this cost

Pam:
I dont know It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to

Andy:
Did you even hear the music I just played for you

Phyllis:
Whats wrong with you

Dwight:
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation Not enough blood getting to my hands

Phyllis:
I think you look nice

Dwight:
Doesnt Charles know hes compromising my attack readiness Its not a dress code Its a death sentence

Charles:
Looking good

Dwight:
When Michael was in charge this place was like the Roman Empire And the Wild West And wartorn Poland And Poland There was just a lot going on so what you wore to work was the least of anybodys worries And in that chaos I soared

Dwight:
Hey Eds Tires is thinking of making a change

Dwight:
Michael you know I cant take this

Dwight:
But dont forget you owe me 10

Michael:
That was four years ago Why dont you let it go

Andy:
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there

Jim:
I think she just didnt want a crucifix cake

Andy:
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down

Jim:
Am I going down a road

Andy:
When I see her bossing you around like that it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance

Jim:
Its so scary how right the things youre saying are And youre coming at it with almost no knowledge so of course I trust your opinion on this

Jim:
I was going to use today to purge my inbox but now something much more pressing has come up

Michael:
Eds Tires Why dont you tell them that we have fewer clients so we can spend more time with each of them Also try to discuss it over Indian food and try to mention how you distrust women

Pam:
Im not gonna do that

Michael:
That is smart That would not seem genuine Ryan

Ryan:
I can get there

Ryan:
Oh awesome

Michael:
Bring it in Morning cheer clears throat

Michael, Pam & Ryan:

Andy:
Oh man he got me so good I learned something about myself today Yeah I wish this was a sofa cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours

Dwight:
Its not the soil Its the manure Paper is the manure Ontime delivery is the soil Aah runs into office

Secretary:
Uh hello Dwight

Dwight:
Spin move

Dwight:
Ha ha April 13th 2002

Mr. Schofield:
Dwight Im in a meeting

Michael:
Thats very rude

Dwight:
I barge because I care April 13th 2002 that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased

Mr. Schofield:
Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our

Dwight:
La la la Continuing  Notice my persistence and recall Continuing You called Dunder Mifflin and your order was filled within an hour

Dwight:
What hes not telling you is that he will abandon you

Mr. Schofield:
Why dont you guys just email me your best offers and we can finish it up that way

Michael:
That sounds like a fantastic idea I will see you this weekend for the Penguins Box seats as usual

Mr. Schofield:
Uh ok sure

Michael:
Good good good I will see you

Dwight:
Thank you Mr Schofield for your time Much appreciated Oh and tell me um hows your gay son

Michael:
I color code all my info I wrote gay son in green Green means go so I know to go ahead and shut up about it Orange means Orange you glad you didnt bring it up Most colors mean Dont say it

Dwight:
How is Tom the homosexual sophomore

Michael:
I wanted to start a company not a war Because in a war you always fight those you are closest to And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother For what What purpose did that serve Apart from abolishing slavery In that case war was the right choice This doesnt feel as important though Thats just how the world works I guess

Michael:
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good And if a friend cant make you feel good then I dont want any friends Except Dwight because he is our only source of fertile leads

Michael:
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners

Ryan:
Uncle Dave

Michael:
Hes undercutting us big time Hes actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket

Ryan:
Thats my family When you mess with my family I cant be responsible for my actions

Pam:
When are you ever responsible for your actions

Ryan:
Get off my ass you hag

Michael:
Hey hey hey Something about that seems inappropriate

Michael:
Betrayal aint just a river in Egypt

Andy:
Who is that knocking on my taste buds Why its Mr Lemon Hmmm nice to meet you

Pam:
Its good But wont it feel weird cutting into a cross

Andy:
Dont think of it as a cross in the JudeoChristian sense think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage

Jim:
When I think of it like that I do not think of the other connotations

Pam:
I dont think so Andy

Jim:
Sorry Her day

Jim:
Are they looking at me

Andy:
Who

Jim:
Everyone Everyone just keeps looking at me

Andy:
Are you sure

Michael:
Its 430 in the morning  Do you know where your kids are  If you are Ryans parents or Pams parents or my parents you do  Theyre gonna be in this van  With me  Who am I  Nothing to fear  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route

Michael:
honking horn Time to make the donuts laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van  Come on  Whoa No I promise I wont do it again  Come on  does it again Denied

Ryan:
Weve been making 500 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now  Ever since Ive gotten clean theres something about fresh morning air that just really makes me sick

Pam:
We got the van at a used car lot  We think it says Alleluia Church of Scranton in Korean  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it

Pam:
You didnt happen to bring any coffee did you Michael

Michael:
Milk and sugar

Pam:
Oh awesome  Youre a life saver  drinks from coffee cup Wait is this just milk and sugar

Michael:

Dwight:

Charles:
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott

Stanley:
What are we supposed to do  They keep undercutting us on price

Andy:
Hey Boss Uh Id just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys

Charles:
Why are you telling me this

Andy:
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie

Andy:
I dont want to have said that  But I think its important that you know it

Charles:
I dont know what to do to inspire these people Okay maybe its my fault

Dwight:
Its not your fault Some people just dont want to be inspired

Angela:
Charles I got your memo Thank you I want you to know Im putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports  Waste not want not

Charles:
Uh well said Angela

Michael:
You know what we need  We need some couches in here

Ryan:
Michael we should really consider getting a delivery guy

Pam:
Why would I love that Can we afford a delivery guy

Michael:
Like in a dorm room  You put your desk underneath you have your loft up top  You can sleep up top

Pam:
Yeah I know what a loft is

Ryan:
Most dorm rooms dont even have that

Michael:
Most do in the magazines

Ryan:
Lets see what a delivery guy costs

Michael:
We should look into that  Or we just go for the loft

David Wallace:
Would you let Charles know that David is here please  Jim hey

Jim:

Dwight:
David Wallace Hello weve been expecting you David Wallace  Charles and I were waiting for you

Charles:
There he is There he is  How was the trip up

Charles:

David:

Charles:
Oh yeah take your time  Stanley pay attention

Kelly:

David:
Hello  Uh it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business  And Im here I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback

Charles:

Charles:
Uh Jim hold on whispers You know David uh Dwights been my guy  Okay

David:
Hmm

Charles:
Yeah Jim

David:
I find that extraordinarily surprising

Charles:
He shows promise and Jim I dont know I hes been a disappointment

David:
Well bring them both in

Dwight:
Come along afterthought

Michael:
They are correct sir

Michael:
Okay A lame attempt at humor  Swing and a miss

Michael:
Lowest in town

Financial Guy:
Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin cant match your prices

Pam:
Corporate greed

Ryan:
Look our price model is fine I reviewed the numbers myself  Over time with enough volume we become profitable

Financial Guy:
Yeah with a fixed cost pricing model thats correct

Ryan:
Yeah

Michael:
Hello

Erin:
Hi

Ryan:
Michael you  havent even heard

Michael:
Never accept their first offer  What is your second offer

David:
1200000

Michael:
Are you kidding me  That is insultingly low  I dont even want to hear what your first offer was

Angela:
What do you hear

Kelly:
mumbles

David:
Heres the situation  Your company is four weeks old  I know this business  I know what suppliers are charging  I know you cant be making very much money  I dont know how your prices are so low but I know it cant keep up that way  Im sure youre scared  Probably in debt This is the best offer youre gonna get

Michael:
Ill see your situation and Ill raise you a situation  Your company is losing clients left and right  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and youre going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO  So I dont think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin  I think I just have to wait out you

David:
Okay now I dont know that I can get this I do have to go to the board for approval Hows about 60000  Hmm  600000  Michael

Ryan:
Well have to talk about this

Pam:
Mmhmm

Michael:

Pam:

Pam:
Are you kidding me

Dwight:
May I have your attention  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke

Charles:
What  Howd you hear that

Dwight:
Theyve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money  That can only mean one thing  Theyre desperate  Which can only mean one thing  Theyre total failures

Jim:
Great work Dwight

Jim:
No I mean great detective work  Cause this must be the first case youve ever cracked right

Dwight:
You dont crack a case  That has pejorative connotation  Thats like calling a policeman a cop  You solve a case and yes Ive solved plenty

Charles:
So how long can they stay viable

Jim:
What are your top five cases

Dwight:
Im gonna answer Charles first

Jim:
Because youve solved zero cases

Dwight:
Okay one Case of the beet bandit  Missing beets from all over the farm  No footprints Inside job  Mose in socks  Boom case closed

Charles:

Charles:
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today  Got it

Michael:
No

Pam:
Can you give us another minute please

Pam:
Michael

Ryan:
How could you do this to me Michael  You just cost me 60000

Pam:
Why are you assuming youd get the whole thing

Michael:
Its a lot of money okay  But we need money coming in every week  We need jobs  Wouldnt you rather have a fishing pole than a fish

Ryan:
I would rather have 60000 honestly

Michael:
Agreed

Ryan:

Michael:
These are our demands

David:
Your company cannot be worth that much

Michael:
Our company is worth nothing  Thats the difference between you and I  Business isnt about money to me David  If tomorrow my company goes under I will just start another paper company  And  then another and another and another  I have no shortage of company names

Michael:
Thats one of em Yes  These are our demands  This is what we want  Our balls are in your court

There are certain defining moments in a persons life  The day he is born  The day he grows hair  The day he starts a business And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin  What have I learned from all of this  It is far too early to tell  I just know that I am flying high and I dont even want to think about it  I just want to enjoy it

Charles:

Attention office Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown Ohio I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something This location is the Superior Court 

Pam:
So someone is going to a court Big deal

Dwight:
It is a big deal Cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative To obtain a learners permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15 Erin let me see your birth certificate

Erin:
Sure

Jim:
So it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period

Pam:
Tell em how it happened

Jim:
Ok So were going through all the wedding plans and boy it is complicated

Jim:

Pam:
Hey Kelly

Kelly:
Ugh so jealous of your boobs

Pam:
Thank you  Um listen I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding which is totally understandable and more than fine

Kelly:
Is Ryan going

Pam:
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding  Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls  whispers Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls  normal volume Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off if they came  So now people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work

Kelly:
Heres the deal  I really want to go but Im not gonna go if Ryan doesnt go because its kind of a waste of time  That came out wrong  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because Id really like to be there to support Jim

Andy:
What can I do for ya Hoss

Michael:
staring into the conference room How are your sales doin

Andy:
How are my sales doin  Busted  My numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy  Youre not buying it youre good  Okay the truth is I have been having trouble focusing lately  Im in this weird flirty nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer

Phyllis:
Again with the cousin

Andy:
Oh Im sorry Phyllis you explain this email okay   Hey Andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together ha ha

Michael:
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that Im completely overwhelmed

Michael:
You know when they say its so crazy it just might work  Well I dont believe that  I say go for the airtight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart  It is just elegant

Michael:
in the cheese cart Be my eyes

Stanley:
What have we here

Andy:
Oh just backing up and turning around

Andy:
Dit dit dit dit its not for you enters the conference room  Pardon moi Messieurs  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room

David:
Cheese platter

Andy:
Oui Oui Monsieur  From the Wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar  Also from the great state of Wisconsin an aged parmesan  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think youll  find both challenging and delicious  At that point I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing  If I may be so bold its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese  Bon appetit

David:
Alright well I should go  Thanks for this  Youve given me a lot to think about  Please promise me you wont do anything until we speak

Jim:
No I wont   Alright thanks for giving me your time  I appreciate it

David:
Thank you Jim

David:

Dwight:

Toby:

Pam:
Hey Ryan

Pam:
So I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding

Ryan:

Pam:
It costs about 75 per person

Ryan:
Okay I once had a glass of Cognac that cost 77

Pam:
Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not

Ryan:
Yes Im coming to your wedding

Ryan:
Probably yes

David:
Are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites

Michael:
Look who youre talking to

David:
Im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents

Michael:
Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man woman or child to have ever run this branch ever

David:
What about Jim  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position

Michael:
looks at Jim   Permission to speak on the record

David:
Please do

David:
I thought you liked Jim

Michael:
Very much Jim is my best friend But its his performance report right here  Now this was written by Toby who we all know is extremely reliable

David:
reading performance report  Constant office distractions spends way too much time at reception antagonizes other salesman not at all what he thinks he is

Michael:
Its not very well written but you get the gist

David:
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch

Michael:
I can just continue to run it myself

David:
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position

Michael:
This was Jims idea

David:
Mmhmm

Michael:
Wow  Ummm well Id have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block

David:
Ummm okay heres the thing though  The plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you  I was hoping plus we have to worry about Jim he has another job offer  We may have to replace him

David:
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second

Jim:
Sure

Michael:
after talking to David Jim looks dejected I cant help but feel partially responsible

Michael:
shakes jelly beans Little pick me up  Jim accepts Oh those are the best  Little sugar rush

Jim:
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace did I come up at all

Michael:
Well we did talk about how handsome you are

Jim:
Why dont we head in your office to talk

Michael:
Oh what a week God  We said I know there were certain things we said

Jim:
Michael look Ill just be honest with you  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion  I actually think that talk went really well  And then after he spoke with you for some reason it felt like things had changed

Michael:
Hmmm thats weird thats weird its kinda weirding me out  Did you know that Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy

Jim:
Michael did you say anything

Michael:
Tell you what when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion

Jim:
You will  Wanna do it right now

Michael:
Yes

Jim:
I tried to keep Michael in the dark  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark

Dwight:
I need to see your pupils   I need to see if theyre dilated

Toby:
If they were dilated

Darryl:
Toby Dwight  Is that them

Darryl:

David:
So what youre changing your mind about Jim

Michael :
Absolutely turns speakerphone off not turns speakerphone back on  Like I said before Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job

David:
Michael it seems like youre cutting in and out This is not what you said earlier

Michael:
Wha heres the thing Jim is the best man for this job I think you should give it to him

David:
Well it doesnt change what you showed me in Jims file

Michael:
Well nnnn that that was an anomaly  That file had been falsified  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs

David:
Michael I really dont know whats going on police sirens in background down there but oh dammit I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell dammit

Darryl:
Cool

Dwight:
Wait  Theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator

Toby:
What

Dwight:
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment case closed

Darryl:
Stupidest thing Ive ever heard

Dwight:
Really  Then why is there new wood only on one railing  Hmmm   We should check the security tapes Toby

Toby:
Well I dont think theres any reason to check em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain

Darryl:
Alright yeah fine so whatever

Dwight:
Yes

Dwight:
Now I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form

Darryl:
And Im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister

Dwight:

Toby:
Ahhh kay  Look we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork but you know we can just move on with our with our lives

Michael:
Hey hey Jim it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face  Alright  Just do it

Jim:

David:
Hey guys so I spoke to Alan we had kind of an unconventional idea which I think is pretty cool  But it only works if everyones on board

Michael:
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager

Jim:
Wow that sounds pretty cool

Michael:
I like that so manager and comanager

David:
Comanager and Comanager  See there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs

Michael:
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager

David:
Alright hey Michael can you pick up for one second  Michael picks up phone Okay look Im not going to force you into anything  If youre willing to lose Jim fine you just say so and well find another solution okay  Is that what you want to do

Ryan:
You know its a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy Look at these actresses Some of them lose weight

Phyllis:
Hey did you guys register for wedding gifts

Pam:
We did but mostly because people expect us to Were also accepting other gifts not on the registry However much

Pam:
Its awkward asking people for money but we could really use it Why doesnt Crate  Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash

Phyllis:
Perfect I hate registries

Phyllis:
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes I know I shouldnt tell you but youll still be suprised when you see it Youre not registered for a birdhouse are you

Jim:
Okay Michael I thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these

Michael:
What do you mean by these people

Jim:
Michael this is a conference room meeting

Michael:
Oh hey everybody I think that Jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room

Jim:
Thats not what I meant

Michael:
Listen Jim no offense but when push comes to shove what I want is more important that what you want

Jim:
I disagree

Michael:
What do you guys think all start talking at the same time

Jim:
Great Guys can I just have a moment alone with Michael

Michael:
No no no you dont need to go anywhere Anything that Jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people

Jim:
That is not what I said and also I am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore I am also I comanager

Michael:
That is not what Wallace told us

Jim:
Thats exactly what Wallace told us

Michael:
That is not the way I heard it

Kelly:
I love rivalries Michael or Jim Paris or Nicole Heidi or LC Its so much fun But I guess if Im really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly Id have to go with LC  Heidis a bad friend and her skin is terrible

Michael:
It is one thing me giving you the comanager title It is another thing you bossing me around

Jim:
Im not bossing you around Im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call David Wallace

Michael:
No no no No we will not call David Wallace Michael pulls out his cell phone I will call David Wallace

Erin:
David Wallace is on line two for you guys

Michael:
Or David Wallace will call us on line two Why dont we just

Jim:
Hey David You got Jim here

David Wallace:
Hey guys um Im calling because unfortunately we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year and I know people expect it However there just is only a small amount of money for each branch so were leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it

Michael:
Got it Dave Sounds like your classice bigpicture decision

Jim:
Which will clearly affect the daytoday wellbeing of our employees

David Wallace:
Its probably a little of both

Michael:
Which is it more of

David Wallace:
Excuse me

Jim:
David I know that Im very new at this but I have a very good perspective on how things work

David Wallace:
Wait Im sorry Michael are you are you texting me

Jim:
Nope not at all

Michael:
No it will not be I am on top of it

David Wallace:
Very good

Jim:
Alright thanks alot David

Michael:
Talk to you later Jim hangs up Okay you didnt let me say goodbye sighs and claps hands once Alright I am looking forward to this

Jim:
You dont have to lie

Michael:
I hate the fact that we have to do this together I think we work better separately When I am irritated and I look at you I dont see you anymore

Jim:
Right

Michael:
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are

Jim:
Alright Lets get started

Creed:
Hey why havent we ever um

Jim:
Do you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll

Jim:
Its hard to tell so far

Michael:
You use your brain too much

Michael:
As I was saying it

Jim:
Yeah Okay so for the 15 increase pro everyone gets a little bit

Michael:
in nerdy voice Con you look like a nerd

Jim:
Con no one gets as much as they did last year

Michael:
Pro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds

Michael:
Con you unzip your pants and you find that theres a calculator down there

Kevin:
Hey Pam I heard that you were registered but I didnt hear where

Pam:
I dont think we registered anywhere We just want cash

Kevin:
Like money Like you you want my money

Pam:
Mmhmm

Kevin:
Will you take a check

Pam:
Yeah

Kevin:
Cool In the memo line Im gonna write To loves eternal glory

Kevin:
Wait til Monday

Pam:
Is this what Ive become Materialistic Shallow I feel horrible looks down at the check oh look Mrs Pam Halpert Thats the first time Ive seen it in writing

Jim:
You know the more I think about it the more I think we should give it to the salesmen

Michael:
That will not go over well

Michael:
Oh my God Are you gonna make another pro and con list Im gonna kill myself

Michael:
No I could not do that Jim I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect If I can just think this through if I could just think it exactly right I can make this perfect and then I can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue

Jim:
Michael

Michael:
And then another

Jim:
Look you have a lot of strengths

Michael:
Oh I do Tell me what they are

Jim:
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well

Michael:
Ha That I am not known for that

Jim:
But there is a reason why Im here

Michael:
Yes You went over my head to Wallace

Jim:
No its because you also have a lot of weaknesses Michael

Michael:
Okay Well why dont you tell me what those are Jim Why dont you enliven me

Jim:
I dont think youre good at making tough decisions

Michael:
Ah

Michael:
Okay heres a tough decision for you You suck You suck Is that clear enough for you

Jim:
But maybe Im here for a reason because I might have some good ideas too Ive been sitting out there and Ive been learning a lot and maybe I can just bring something different to the table

Michael:
Okay Skippy here we go Why dont you run yourself out there and tell them laughs You call it

Jim:
leave the conference room to address everyone

Michael:
to the camera This had better be terrible

Jim:
Could I have everyones attention please I have some tough news so Im just gonna give it to you straight Truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont Now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff

Meredith:
Wait Seriously

Jim:
Look you guys are smart so Im just leveling with you Im just trying to treat you like adults

Oscar:
Thank you Jim for thinking that were smart people

Angela:
But I do not understand If were such smart adults then why dont we get raises

Oscar:
Excellent question genius Its because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with

Jim:
Ooh easy Thats not it at all

Oscar:
Well

Kelly:
walks in from shopping with bags in her hands Whats going on

Kevin:
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen

Kelly:
What the hell Why are you being such a jerk

Oscar:
Hold on Kelly Would it help you to know that Jim thinks youre smart

Kelly:
No puts down her bags How is that gonna repair Ryans car

Jim:
Okay Dwight you know what Youd be getting the raise so

Oscar:
Exactly

Kevin:
Totally

Oscar:
We work just as hard as the sales people We deserve raises

Angela:
Yes They dont get em if we dont get em

Meredith:
My kid needs shoes You want to tell him he doesnt get shoes

Dwight:
Her kid needs shoes Jim

Meredith:
What the hell everyone complaining at Jim

Jim:
Wow Im just gonna rewind and back off a bit so imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles Michael comes over by Jim laughing

Michael:
That was good That was good Okay all right Well we all know its hard to be a boss right You know what Look around you These are your best friends These are the people who will open their hearts to you They all have heartons for you someone growns in disgust and that is a gift So in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts Angela yes lend Oscar a cup of sugar This

Angela:
What are you talking about Michael

Stanley:
We just need to hear your plan for our raise

Michael:
My plan a man panama

Andy:
Thats not how that goes

Meredith:
Youre not saying anything At least Jim was being direct

Jim:
Thank you Meredith

Meredith:
when he was telling us his dumbass plan

Oscar:
We would just like to know whats happening Are we getting a raise yes or no

Michael:
Alright Let me get this clear Does everybody want a raise all say yes Alright everyone wants a raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do

Oscar:
Again that gives us no information

Phyllis:
This isnt a game you know Its our livelihood

Michael:
What about a raise based on merit

Jim:
sarcastically Well obviously Too bad hes a temp and doesnt count so lets get started starts to write on a piece of paper

Jim:
Nope Im numbering the paper

Oscar:
everyone talking to the camera Just

Kevin:
Yeah I dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us

Angela:
Its not like were not gonna see the checks Were in accounting

Dwight:
out the side of his mouth And Jim

Creed:
Yep

Jim:
to camera Its going really well actually

Jim:
to camera holds up a bean Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise We each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture walking around the table of who you think deserv whos that picture that Michael drew of toby looks like a monster

Michael:
Toby

Jim:
Hes not a part of this You know that

Michael:
Just wanted to draw a picture of him

Jim:
Okay your move

Michael:
Alright Who to pick walking around the table Who to pick

Jim:
Here we go

Michael:
I will skip a turn

Jim:
Okay youre gonna still have to play that bean You know that

Michael:
I need more time

Erin:
Wallace sent an email about a meeting next week He wants you both to respond Michael and Jim leave Dwight sneaks in

Dwight:
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is Its great Eventually theyll rise up and revolt My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later If the people here were our founding fathers the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years because Stanley Washington was napping and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly

Dwight:
Come on in everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table   Thats right Come in feast your eyes They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces

Dwight:
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager

Michael:
Hey what are you guys doing in here

Kevin:
What does a bean mean

Pam:
Why arent there any beans on this very old frizzyhaired picture of me

Kevin:
Michael what does a bean mean

Pam:
Jim

Oscar:
Someone please explain it to Kevin

Meredith:
Why cant you My time is just as valuable as yours

Angela:
This is how you make this important decision

Andy:
Theres no way that Stanley gets more beans than me starts to take Stanleys beans Stanley swats Andys hand with his crossword puzzle That is ridiculous This is how it works everyone continues to argue

Andy:
Thank you That is exactly by the way I would also like a raise

Phyllis:
Yeah I would too

Phyllis:
I say no

Dwight:
No I mean what do you say to my plan all groan Okay

Michael:
leaving his office hurrying to Jims office

Michael:
in Jims office How you doing

Jim:
Uh on a scale of one to ten Id say Im about a four

Michael:
Oh what are you usually

Jim:
Six You

Michael:
Usually a ten but Im feeling like a zero

Jim:
I mean a performancebased raise sounded like a good idea right

Michael:
I know I know

Jim:
We tried to find the fairest way to do it

Michael:
Yes we did

Jim:
I just what

Phyllis:
Michael

Kevin:
Michael

Phyllis:
Come on This isnt fair

Phyllis:

Ryan:

Question for you Would you guys rather have 100 now or 5000 a year from now

Pam:
100 now for sure

Pam:
Yeah No no Ill um the hundred Ill just take the hundred

Ryan:
Instead of 5000 a year from now

Pam:
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game

Pam:
Im sorry You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately So if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume and if your lunch is especially pungent maybe have it in the break room

Jim:
We would really appreciate it

Dwight:
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy If she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed Its amazing A three ounce fetus is calling the shots Its so bad ass

Pam:
Phyllis if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two Yours is kind of perfumy

Phyllis:
Now this is getting ridiculous

Dwight:
Oh gee Im sorry I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant No I reserve the right to peel my hardboiled eggs at my desk

Meredith:
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and Im not stopping for anyone

Pam:
I dont think Im asking for too much I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace

Michael:
standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding What do you think I spent all morning on it

Jim:
It is really special

Pam:
Yeah but arent you supposed to do that to our no Its great

Michael:

Dwight:

Pam:

Angela:

Pam:
Like a year

Jim:
Ive been driving stick since high school So yes For a really long time thats all I had I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with but I think even then I knew that I was waiting for my wife So  I would like to propose a toast So if youd all raise your glasses Not Pam for obvious reasons but everyone else If you would raise your glasses

Mema:

Grotti:
As a manager of business you have a lot of pride

Michael:
Mmhm

Grotti:
But you also got a lot of responsibility

Michael:
Yep

Grotti:
None greater perhaps than your need to be sure that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss

Michael:
There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman than having to listen to a bad salesman Its like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player

Andy:
What do you think

Dwight:
I think youre right It definitely looks suspicious And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags

Grotti:
God forbid you  should have a fire in the warehouse

Michael:
Oh yup Yeah definitely All that paper burning up

Grotti:
Yeah and a truck goes off the side of the road theres injury

Michael:
Mmhm I hear you The truck

Grotti:

Michael:
Do your worst they shake hands

Michael:
Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat Oh great

Andy:
What happened in there

Michael:
Nothing other than once again I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman

Dwight:

No Dwight not everything is a threat

Mobsters are

Michael:
There is no such things as monsters

Andy:
He drives an SUV

Dwight:
I knew it More trunk space Or should I say corpse space

Dwight:
No not that by itself But look at all the facts He seems like a mobster

Andy:
All mobsters have a front sometimes its selling insurance sometimes its waste management or sanitation

Oscar:
For the record not all ItalianAmericans are in the Mafia

Andy:
Yeah buy my insurance or Ill burn your warehouse down

Dwight:
Exactly

Michael:
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer

Oscar:
Uhh All right who else is here looks around

Oscar:
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon So theres not the usual balance between sane and others Toby has mentally checked out since June Its a very dangerous time The coalition for reason is extremely weak

Andy:
Not only that but if they find out you snitched you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed

Michael:

Dwight:
You know what

Michael:
Thats not gonna happen

Dwight:
Thats an exaggeration

Andy:
When somebody threatens you you give in right away Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back

Michael:
I was thinking exactly the same thing

Andy:
Dwight

Dwight:
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him Trust me I have bullied a lot of people

Michael:
I dont know I dont know about that

Andy:
Okay

Dwight:
Let him know youre not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down That youre stubborn That you might even be a little bit dangerous

Andy:
Are you saying

Dwight:
Michael Incredible news Grotti is clean

No Hes not Hes just good Nothing sticks to him You still dont understand how this works

Andy:
Class act Boy scout

Dwight:

Michael:
grunts

Michael:
If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars Bury them in my yard And I wouldnt tell the cops a thing Not that I would be lying per se But I would just get really quiet all of a sudden

Grotti:

Dwight:
What were you talking about in there

Michael:
in the conference room leading a meeting Due to a certain recent incident corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities

Andy:
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill

Michael:
That was a hit job  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and Im not sure that there is it is that in order to help our communities we need to put other peoples needs ahead of our own

Pam:
Haha  Ha ha ha

Jim:
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a 50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice  everyone claps and makes comments

Meredith:
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders

Jim:
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate because as we all know the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change

Dwight:
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum and you are attacked by triads how can you hold them off until your clan arrives  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch screams pretends to punch Meredith in the throat

Jim:
OK so theres no defense for that good to know

Jim:
OK with all due respect to everyone here I think the most worthy opponent of you is you

Dwight:
That is correct  Unless there happened to be measles present

Jim:
So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch  Now how would you Dwight defend against it

Dwight:
Easy  Allow me to demonstrate  I am attacking myself with a throat punch  Here it comes gives himself a fake throat punch  Block  Grasp wrist as such grasps wrist

Jim:
And what if he comes at you with the other hand because he does have two

Dwight:
Good point  Second throat punch absorb the blow gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself  Groin punch hip block elbow to the gut  Uh oh up to the nose  No youre not  Ow  Oh

Jim:
Oh my God hes making you look like such a fool

Dwight:
He really is but not for long  steps on foot  Ow Instep oh not again  more screaming You let go you let go  Oh youre right I cant hold on

Jim:
You two are so evenly matched I dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand

Dwight:
The important thing to remember Jim we always have what is called the element of surprise hits himself in the groin and moans

Michael:
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy

Andy:
I did stand up comedy once

Michael:
You did

Andy:
Yeah I killed

Michael:
That sounds like it was hilarious

Andy:
It was hilarious

Michael:
Yes

Dwight:
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got

Michael:
Youll have to be more specific Dwight I get like eight emails a day

Dwight:
This one from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin

Michael:
Woo hoo shout out

Dwight:
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal  I just want to stress that its all conjecture  If theres any concrete news you will know ASAP

Michael:
Erin do we have the journal

Michael:
Did you

Michael:
Oh the Wall

Oscar:
I found the article everyone walks over to his desk he begins reading the article  On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflins  It is rumored that they will recommend  and the article cuts off

Michael:
Its 199 to finish the article  I wonder what it was going to say no one makes a move to pay for the article

Jim:
Are you serious starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer

Andy:
I got it I got it Oh Tuna beat me to it

Phyllis:
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy

Michael:
No no that doesnt make any sense

Stanley:
Oh lord were all gonna lose our jobs

Oscar:
Not necessarily bankruptcy could mean a lot of things  Maybe theyre just restructuring to get out of debt

Michael:
Oh that sounds awful

Oscar:
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin

Michael:
Oh God  Well thats an interesting theory

David Wallace's Secretary:
Im sorry Michael Davids in a meeting

David Wallace's Secretary:

Stanley:
Thats ok

Michael:
There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company But 70 percent of me is water and the other part the real part the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and if I can be crass makes babies that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba

You know Michael you have more experience in sales and management so Im gonna defer to your judgment

Of course I seesaw Mose and I seesaw all the time

Ryan:
No uh the movie Did you see the movie Saw

Dwight:
Oh yeah Great film Almost as fun as going on a seesaw

Ryan:
Okay the reason these movies are so popular is the element of psychological torment

Dwight:
I like where youre going with this Continue

Ryan:
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something

Dwight:
I have an old barn

Ryan:
Yes

Dwight:
Its kinda smelly but that might be a plus And then what

Dwight:
Hes supposed to cut his leg off Think

Dwight:

Pregnant Pam and I we get hungry at the same times so weve been eating together a lot  Not all meals  Just second breakfast lunch second lunch and first dinner

Pam:
Mmmm that sounds great  What are you thinking

Kevin:
I think it should be a surprise

Meredith:
After Pam has a contraction  Oh getting there huh

Pam:
No no  I still have time

Pam:
Im having contractions but theyre irregular and far apart  So Im not really in labor Im near labor

Pam:
If we check in after midnight I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors

Jim:
Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if its crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it  And I do not plan on helping unless its a boy

Pam:
I cannot wait for that joke to be over

Pam:
Ooh

Jim:
Michael

Michael:
Actually I put diesel in this time trying to save some money

Michael:
Happy to do it  Also I did a heck of a job babyproofing this office

Jim:
Hmm that logics airtight but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here  Burning man portopotty

Pam:
Okay okay were not going to the hospital  We are waiting until midnight

Erin:
Ooh spooky  But why

Jim:
Because the insurance company only covers two nights

Pam:
Everythings fine  We have plenty of time

Michael:
Shut up Nick  What a weird thing to say  Weird IT nerd  Dont get revenge on me nerd

Angela:
as Nick looks over at her  What are you looking at

Dwight:
Ha nerd

Kelly:
Did you know that labor can last weeks  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table and sometimes epidurals dont work and you can poop yourself

Angela:
Excuse me

Dwight:
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother  If you agree say nothing  If you disagree say anything  Very well  Lets meet at 400 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out

Jim:
after Pam has another contraction  Thats seven minutes  Here we go  This is happening  Come on

Pam:
Hold on hold on  It isnt midnight yet

Jim:
Are you serious  Pam

Pam:
No the doctor said every five to seven minutes

Jim:
I  Pam please

Pam:
Im going to be okay we should really try to make it until midnight

Andy:
Yeah no you really should  Because if your babys born tomorrow hes going to have the same birthday as Buttmud Brooks  My old roommate

Pam:
Did you hear that  Buttmud Brooks

Jim:
Okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart

Pam:
Five minutes apart

Jim:
So the plan was seven minutes  But were calling an audible because thats her call  Because shes the quarterback  Im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant

Pam:
Okay stop watching me

Jim:
Okay crazy  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you like sell printers

Pam:
Mmhmm

Jim:
Well not until Friday 20 off toner cartridges thats a big deal  While were on the subject why dont I just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check

Pam:
Not until midnight

Andy:
Guys  Word of advice  Speaking as a former baby  Dont get too hung up on baby names  I was named Walter Jr after my father until I was about six or so when my parents changed their minds

Erin:
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr

Andy:
My brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr name so they gave it to him  I was given Andrew which they got out of a baby name book

Jim:
You know its getting real crowded in here  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet

Michael:
No no no no no  You know what  You cant tell us what to do because you are not comanager anymore

Jim:
as Andy and Kevin shout yeah in response to Michael Okay I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals

Pam:
Actually the distractions are good  I mean I dont think Im going to make it until midnight if Im just sitting here thinking about it

Michael:
Distractions are good  That means conference room five minutes  No no five seconds  Right now right now  Conference room  Topic potpourri  Lets go

Michael:
Um I am sort of a master of distraction  When I was a kid my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class  Try to think what were the first thirteen colonies  Mmhmm mmhmm  Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises

Michael:
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body

Andy:
Can we do sleight of hand tricks

Michael:
I will allow that

Andy:
Yes  Can anyone do those

Stanley:
Im going to go look at the Internet

Jim:
as Pam has another contraction  Oh  Oh alright  Thats a good one

Michael:
Okay

Kelly:
Oh my God Pam you are a woman warrior

Pam:
Oh thanks Kelly

Michael:
Does anybody have anything  Anything interesting any hobbies uh special skills

Pam:
Yes this is the only time Im ever going to make this request

Michael:
Yes Phyl

Phyllis:
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club

Andy:
I can do the evolution of dancedance

Andy:
Nope actually music would just throw me off  I need complete silence  Okay  Pam begins to clap as Andy dances  Youre clapping  I need complete silence  Totally threw me off so Im going to have to start over  Evolution of dancedance

Ryan:
reading from a book as Kelly admires  You let me in your bed  But now I sleep alone  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home

Erin:
naming race horses  Affirmed  Seattle Slew  Secretariat  Citation  Assault  Count Fleet  Rollaway  War Admiral  Omaha  Gallant Fox  And  I know this  Uh  The jockey was Johnny Loftus  Sired by Star Shoot

I am so proud of Sabres Print In All Colors initiative Any Sabre employee of color is welcome to apply Kelly applauds  Daryl

Michael:
Okay

Daryl:
The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper but printers and paper ship differently Itll be faster to deliver them separately instead of waiting on everything to come in

Daryl:
Not at all Theres a way that it can be scheduled I sketched this out downstairs

Jo:
Oh look at you

Michael:
Look at that picture that you drew Nice job Were very proud of you You know what were gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen

Michael:
Over the last few weeks things have been changing here Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads I think its kind of screwed up because the way this place used to work was make friends first make sales second make love third in no particular order

Dwight:

Michael:
Mhmm

Michael:

Stanley:
We need those leads Michael Its our job Michael Michael

Gabe:
on phone Michael we spent a lot of money on those leads You have to give them out

Michael:
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour Okay Just  imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone you got an icecream cone If that were the case then in the summertime everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an icecream cone

Gabe:
Michael I dont want to incentivise murder But  weve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff 

Gabe:
But you do You are in charge 

Michael:
Hmm Well if that is what I am required to do I will do exactly that

Michael:
Exactly that

Gabe:

Michael:

Gabe:
Hey everyone Hi Quite an afternoon huh Cathartic in a way Im glad I got to share it with you It makes you think about whats really important Pam hands Jim a note Its not about showing youre in charge or flexing some sort of authority Its about forgiveness And yes Im talking about you three in this desk clump right here I think that if you were to apologize to me then I would revoke your suspension

Pam:
I dont think an apology is enough I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension

Jim:
And I got to take this bad attitude and I got to go home and I got to adjust it And I hope the suspension does that

Dwight:
gets up and walks towards Gabe Prideful idiots Watch how its done Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave Gabriel I apologize

Michael:
La telefona

Oscar:
El telefono

Oscar:
Michaels having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender And um holds up two blurredout drawings of male and female genitalia I should have been more specific

Michael:

Jim:
Yeah or maybe we dont even need that

Dwight:
You know what I should be getting this client Michael My numbers are better than either of theirs

Michael:
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company

Dwight:
If you want people to put the best face on something why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives

Pam:
We have good give and take vaudeville delivery I give he takes

Jim:

Those dont really count Were thinking more ethnic and racial minorities

Dwight:
Come here Come here

Gabe:
Hmm

Dwight:
Ten seconds ago this guy was driving a forklift Okay Now all off a sudden hes Cinderella of the office What are you guys thinking

Gabe:
Well

Dwight:
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program Who would I refer Hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines

Kelly:
on phone This is the second time that youve sent me the wrong size I mean I know what a four feels like Ive been a four my whole life You know what You can go to Hell All right Thanks for nothing

Dwight:
Oh man White people right

Kelly:
I dont know if she was white

Dwight:
Well you can kinda tell from the voice

Kelly:
Yeah

Dwight:
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race

Kelly:
Never thought of myself as an executive before

Dwight:
I know cause you have no role models How many Indian CEOs can you think of

Kelly:
I cant think of any CEOs any race

Dwight:
You could be the Indian Bill Gates You could be the Indian Ted Turner

Kelly:
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts

Dwight:
Thats not shes okay Yes

Michael:
I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and I want to show you there we go Michaels picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen Whoa look at those vivid colors Look at my eyes Those are Shrekgreen eyes That is me again I think this displays the crisp dazzling white

Donna:
Mmhmm

Michael:
And that would be a display image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up of the crisp gorgeous black

Donna:
Yeah

Michael:
Its subtle Thats how it works I show her an image that turns her on And then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image Soon she doesnt know what is me what is the image She just knows that shes turned on

Donna:
Who took the photo

Michael:
Ryan

Donna:
Oh Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is SEX in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly

Michael:
And thats it Thats me Thats who I am

Donna:
giggles Not bad

Michael:
Oh thanks softly Youre not bad either

Donna:
Thank you Michael tries t kiss Donna Donna clears throat Hmm

Michael:
Hmm

Donna:
Oh my God realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows

Michael:
Jim Could you come in here for a sec What was that printer we were looking at

Jim:
No

Pam:
Ill have one

Jim:
Well maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work

Michael:
Oh really Jim What about Pam And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss Maybe this could be my Pam

Pam:
Maybe Michael has a point I mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be here

Donna:
Was it professional No But I work in the nightlife industry I get hit on all the time In my 20s it would have been annoying In my late 20s I find it really flattering

Michael:
Look I know that I screwed up in there I know that I probably messed up your sale I just want to go in and fix it

Pam:
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim

Jim:
What was that

Jim:
Pam you know hes not gonna get anywhere and hes gonna blow our sale

Pam:
Who cares Michael peeking at them through his office window Its not that huge a sale

Jim:
Hey the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale

Dwight:
How as being a minority affected you

Kelly:
Well theres a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy

Dwight:
Oh good and you resent this because

Kelly:
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants Its so dorky

Dwight:
Oh no no Thats not dorky Dwight wears his phone like that Look its easily accessible Boom like this 911 hello Scranton Stranglers in the house Inside the house

Kelly:
Just put it in your pocket

Michael and Donna:
indistinct chatter inside conference room

Kevin:
looking it Look at that Shes totally flirting with him

Creed:
You ever notice you can ooze two things sexuality and pus Man I tell ya

Phyllis:
She just crossed her arms together thats bad

Pam:
Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger

Kevin:
tries it by crossing his arms Like that to Andy

Donna:
Is this is this the best you can do right there

Jim:
Yeah chuckles

Michael:
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room right

Jim:
Whats that

Michael:
Maybe wee find some wiggle room

Jim:
I dont I dont think so

Michael:
I think we could Donna giggles

Oscar:
I dont see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money Delivery alone will cost

Michael:
Okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right Like for tax purposes

Oscar:
Actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money

Michael:
Why dont you run them again

Jim:
What if shes just flirting with you to get a better price

Kevin:
Yeah Michael heres a trick Ask her if she wants a mint If she says no then she is not interested

Jim:
She does not like him

Pam:
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them How do you think we got together

Jim:
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day

Pam:
I was after your money

Jim:
Well the joke was on you

Pam:
Yes it was

Kelly:
typing Can you stop micromanaging I know how to do this

Ryan:
Tell her everyone in home room thinks shes fat

Kelly:
Oh that is so good

Dwight:
You know we really should keep practicing for this interview

Kelly:
Oh thats okay Ryan coached me

Dwight:
Ryan What does he know

Ryan:
Its easy you just turn every question around on them Do you think youre treated differently because of your race

Kelly:
Would you ask that same question if I was white Were so in

Dwight:
We

Ryan:
And then the two of us are cleanin house

Dwight:
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl If youd have told me this morning that today Id be creating a monster capable f my own destruction I d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate

Lawyer:
Finally theres a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man a la Benjamin Button

Dwight:
Same page Just keep moving

Lawyer:
Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix

Lawyer:
This is essentially

Dwight:
Unless were unplugged

Lawyer:
Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor

Dwight:
And wake up in the future

Lawyer:
Which is actually pretty common So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract

Angela:
What

Lawyer:
So essentially this comes down to damages Now there is some precedence for the range of 30000

Dwight:
What

Dwight:
I dont have 30000 lying around I have it buried very deeply and I dont want to dig past a certain someone to get it

Turns out our printers are famous Theyre all over the news Its an interesting story Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans Well actually the the real story isnt quite as racy but uh lets give it a go

Kevin:
Jo I think that I know what happened

Jo:
Not long ago we discovered a defect in one of our printers so we got a software patch and fixed it right up just like that I dont know how it works But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers giving em free toner and we keep em happy but somebody here they liked that first story better The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason Whoever it was who talked to the press they should come forward please

Michael:
Jo Jo I can assure you it was no one in this office

Jo:
Can you now

Phyllis:
quietly to Andy Put your hand up Norma Rae

Andy:
So unfair Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals I would not be a whistleblower The Bernards for generations have silenced whistleblowers Its how we made all our money Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us sings Old Mr Bernard old Mr Bernard who have you silenced today

Michael:
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this because I know everything there is to know about these people I know when their birthdays are I know what their favorite kind of cake is I know what color streamers they like

Jo:

Jo:
Why dont you come with me Well start out with the honcho whatcha say

When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing shed ask one question What do we do when we find the guilty party And if they said Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice innocent A clear conscience dont need no mercy But if they said Officer Bessie well they may have had a reason blah blah blah blah well nine times out of ten thats the anus theyd check

Jo:
So say we catch this whistleblower what do you think I should do with him

Jo:
Yeah

Angela:
Everybody knows it was Andy and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth

Michael:

Dwight:
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams

Dwight:
Are you referring to alchemy

Jo:
I dont like to tell a man what to do with his money but if you aint investing in property then youre dumber than a dummy

Dwight:

Michael:

Michael:
Oh no no no

Darryl:
I think she could sense my sadness and I and I found out too late that she shes the copy editor at the Trib

Michael:
Oh my god Was she cute

Darryl:
No

Michael:
I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it and then I find out that one of my best ones did And now hes probably going to get fired for it And if that is not poetic justice I dont know what is

Jo:
Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was

Jo:
And we didnt find anything on your computer

Toby:
Good

Jo:
Except this hands stack of paper to Toby

Toby:
Oh wow this is uh just a mystery novel that Ive been working on

Toby:
Oh uh I dont know uh

Jo:
The way I look at it theres only one of two reasons He knows a secret about her that she doesnt know herself or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder

Toby:
Oh yes

Pam:
It was me

Jim:
What was you You were the leak

Pam:

Luke:

Michael:
To get some ice cream for everybody Its national ice cream afternoon Great

Michael:
And another thing I did this summer I hired my nephew

Michael:
Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me because his mother who also happens to be my halfsister kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a  14 The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of Ace Ventura II and that was 95 so yes 15 years on the dot Anyway I lost him in a forest

Pam:

Darryl:
Dont dont bother Luke Got it

Michael:
Come on Okay um draws a circle around Dont with a line through it Thats as clear as I can make it

Phyllis:

Dwight:
Whos gonna tell on us Gabe

Gabe:
Thatd be hilarious Uh Jo theyre creating a hostile work environment Stop  em

Michael:
Nope it wont be Gabe but actually there is somebody in the office that is very very close to Luke

Yes Of course

Toby:
Guys I think Michael and Luke are related

Michael:
No No Toby Hes not Yes he is Hes my nephew

All:
What

Michael:
Luke is my nephew

Oscar:
Michael thats nepotism Luke is getting special treatment because hes your nephew

Michael:
Yes exactly That is a very nice way of putting it Oscar Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing

Darryl:
Whats wrong with a level playing field

Michael:
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson What if no one named Hanson showed up That wouldnt even make sense Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50yearold guy who was a murderer Really safe

Creed:
I couldnt care less about nepotism But Im loving the debate Great minds battling it out And Ive got a front row seat

Michael:
God when he needed help on Earth who did he hire Jesus Christ his son

Erin:
Thats a really tight argument

Michael:
Thank you

Jim:
But youre comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus

Michael:
No No Im just saying why does God get to do something that I dont

Oscar:
This is hypothetical Were talking about Luke who happens to be terrible

Michael:
Well then why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad You just want me to fire Luke Thats reverse nepotism  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does

Kelly:
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field That is actually a zoning issue So thank you

Oscar:
If theres nothing wrong with this Michael why have you been keeping it a secret

Michael:
Because I wanted you to come to me and say Wow he is so great And I was gonna say Well its in the genes And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans And Id point to them right No But you ruined it So thank you very much Here he comes Guys look I dont want you to treat him like anyone else in the office I just want you to treat him like my nephew Hey there he is

Dwight:
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger

Jim:
So by that rationale if I had to sneeze I should just sneeze on you

Dwight:
The principle is sound To avoid illness expose yourself to germs enabling your immune system to develop antibodies I dont know why everyone doesnt do this Maybe they have something against living forever

Dont I

Pam:
Hello hello Youre breaking the law

My point is that as long as people like you and me dont stop talking nobody can stop the USA

Andy:
Yeah clapping

Michael:
I am talking about freedom about choice America I dont think you need to worry Because if you want to beat China you will If you dont thats fine That my friend is your victory Yknow a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China and that may be the true but what they dont tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation you get to a friend So here is to conversation

Oscar:
Thats not

Oscar:
That wasnt what we were discu That wasnt the whole

Jim:
You know whats crazy

Toby:

Jim:
I cant reconnect with you right now Hold on one second he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick misses and shatters a window everyone gasps Excuse me clears throat

Michael:
I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer and some people you dont And thats just the way it is And I can be mature about that clip of Michael throwing Hollys Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it

Angela:
Its so cold Even with my coat on

Meredith:
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans

Gabe:
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy

Holly:
You guys this has to stop Someone could have really gotten hurt

Michael:
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window You know what would have happened The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off And yes it might have been funny But it also would have been incredibly tragic

Dwight:
I could not agree more And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress

Jim:
What are you talking about Youre the one terrorizing me

Dwight:
With snowballs Jim With fluffy little snowballs No I thought we were just playing

Holly:
Dwights right What you did was dangerous and inappropriate Im really surprised at you guys Last time I was here you were both best friends

Michael:
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story You see this on my desk he holds up a toy taxi cab Know who gave me this My girlfriend Tara who lives in New York City

Dwight:
Wait what girlfriend

Michael:
I havent told you about her

Dwight:
I find that unlikely You email me when you get a new zit

Michael:
Im a man in my mid40s and I still get zits I think thats pretty interesting But you know what I am not on trial here The Scranton strangler is So anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to JFK but I am flying out of LaGuardia So we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slomo drinking latte And at the end of the day she gives me this and she says Michael maybe next time you should take a cab

Holly:
I didnt know you had a girlfriend

Michael:
I do She is

Michael:
Did you see her face Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G Scott And it aint Tara

Phyllis:
So you went homemade this year

Phyllis:
Yeah Money problems is that what this is about I mean oh dear I dont think we can help you out

Pam:
No no Jim had a great year actually I just wanted to get your opinion

Phyllis:

Pam:
Look at this

Holly:
walks in with a dirty Woody Who did this Its obvious to me Im not welcome here but somebody better tell me who did this or else Im leaving

Phyllis:
Well I dont think Erin seems to like you

Erin:
Thats not true I dont know her enough to make a decision even

Michael:
What happened What happened Toby what did you do I think Tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting

Toby:
No I would never ever do anything like that But it does seem like something you would do

Michael:
Oh really Turn it on me Well isnt that nice Thank you very much

Michael:
It is Christmas

Angela:
No it really seems like something Michael would do

Michael:
Mmhmm Mmhmm Well the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me And that I have been framed

Jim:
Okay Im sorry why are we discounting this whole Woody came to life thing so quickly

Michael:
Ahhhhhh laughs Surprise It was part of the party Pretty funny huh

Holly:
You think this is funny

Michael:
laughs I dont But someday I think we will laugh about this when we tell our kids

Kevin:
Oh no thats thats not happening

Dwight:
Dear God in heaven

Michael:
All right Shh Okay you know what Holly I didnt mean to do it It was an accident An accident borne of jealous feelings

Holly:
Michael you have to let this go Im with someone else I dont feel that way anymore

Dwight:
Okay hey hey hey

Jim:
No fake girlfriends are always wrong

Holly:
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if Id get jealous And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me What is the matter with you

Erin:
blocks Hollys path No

Holly:
You guys it wasnt my fault

Kevin:
Oh nothing is ever your fault Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us

Erin:

Michael:
Mmm Erin would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me please

Jim:
walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it reading the note Hey Pickles Merry Christmas Open immediately Love Swiss Cheese opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him everyone laughs Damn it Dwight

Dwight:
Didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing did you Jim Let that be a lesson to you all

Stanley:

Wed love to see it

Michael:
Sweet I will go invite Holly

I did not love the dialogue Or the character  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless

Dwight:
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned What was the point of spilling the drink on me

Jan:
He finished his movie frantically trying to open her car door as if trying to get away from the camera crew No kidding Wow thats great Yeah thats good for him

Michael:
By far and away the most expensive shot in the movie But it was integral to the story

Michael:
That was not scripted

Karen:
Why are you singling my line out like a million years later

Michael:
No no Holly this isnt Oceans Eleven where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and dont care about how it turns out Whatd you really think honestly

Holly:
Uhm

Michael:
Is it is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me See because I need you to keep me grounded

Holly:
Not worried about that

Michael:
angrily It was eleven years okay This has been my dream for eleven years and if you dont think its great than youre basically saying that you dont believe in my dream

Holly:
Wha Its your dream and you never even mentioned it before

Holly:
Well why do you have to make a movie at all

Michael:
Yeah youre a real pain in the ass And Im gonna go watch the movie with people who think its great And Im sorry I called you a pain in the ass Im angry and I love you

Holly:
I love you too

Michael:
I am a huge Woody Allen fan Although Ive only seen Antz but Ill tell you something What I respect about that man is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press about how Antz was just a ripoff of A Bugs Life he stayed true to his films  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz The thing is I thought Bugs Life was better much better Than Ants The point is dont listen to your critics listen to your fans

Michael:
Who likes Threat Level Midnight applause from the office Okay then who wants to watch the rest everyone yells approval

Michael:
We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game trying to qualify for states

Michael:
No no Actually its really screwed up because they chuckles they were trying to qualify they were disqualified they had to forfeit the game Undefeated season Thats why there were so many people there Michael stands up clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought

Erin:

Andy:

Erin:
You in the bosss chair

Andy:
EEEHHH No Hehe

Andy:
In my family you dont really go out and get things If you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on Wednesdays and Fridays So I dont know I guess you could say this job is on my list and awkwardly smiling well see what Rosa comes back with

Phyllis:
Oh Im sure theyll let us know when they get the results Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly

Phyllis:
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child

Phyllis:
But probably not I mean it was a big year for babies Porkys had come out

Erin:
Yeah Im sure I was just another Porkys baby

Phyllis:
Mm

Erin:
But why not find out

Phyllis:
Yeah

Pam:
to Dwight who is reading the want ads Should you really be so blatant about that

Dwight:
They wont make me manager and I wont settle for anything less Ive gone about as far as I can here Thats obvious Time to take my talents elsewhere

Pam:
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks

Dwight:
Bread is the paper of the food industry You write your sandwich on it

Warren Buffett:
Can you do any better on salary

Jim:
Unfortunately that range is set at corporate

Jim:
Heh We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous

Warren:
How about 27 And uh when I make longdistance calls will they be monitored or is it on the honor system

Angela:
on phone Okay hangs up smiling How odd a very unusual phone call from the Senators office The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens

Kevin:
The Botanical Gardens Scrantons hidden gem Dont eat any berries you dont recognize

Toby:
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here

Toby:
Uh Human Resources

Robert:
You see I sit across from a man I see his face I see his eyes Now does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deepsea drilling equipment Dont be a fool He wants respect He wants love He wants to be younger He wants to be attractive There is no such thing as a product Dont ever think there is There is only sex Everything is sex You understand that what Im telling you is a universal truth Toby

Toby:
Yes

Gabe:
Okay II am Im almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position Robert and Gabe chuckle at this then Gabe stops chuckling Do you um do you think that you are

Gabe:
No Robert then nods his head at Jim

Jim:
Can you seems intimidated clears throat You are a man of great confidence Could you speak a little more to that and what the role of confidence would be in a dialogue with a subordinate

Robert:
Will you be heard Will you have a voice Will I steamroll over you Do you feel heard right now Jim Do you have a voice right now You can answer me

Jim:
Yes

Robert:
That was your choice not mine The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller It is up to the object whether it will be flattened or not and I can tell from the small interaction weve had already you wont be flattened by anybody Do you agree with me Jim

Jim:
Yes

Robert:
more emphatically than Jim Yes You do nods at the Search Committee then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face

Jim:
Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves He creeps me out Toby nods But I think he might be a genius

Andy:
Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee Good luck Darryl

Darryl:
pats Andy on the back Thank you

Darryl:
Think about it What other mammal besides humans drinks the milk of another mammal I mean you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk

Jim:
Jim and Gabe laugh Toby smiles and nods Oh

Darryl:
So this is cool I think we make a good fit stands up

Toby:
So how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office

Darryl:
I thought that was your job

Toby:
Well its one of my strengths but its the managers job

Jim:
Well for instance how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight

Darryl:
Ill answer that Jim I would use it as an opportunity to teach uh about actions and consequences of actions Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl

Jim:
ignoring Darryls question So I think all we need is a resume and well be good right

Darryl:
I I just thought you knew me

Merv Bronte:
at the cafe on the first floor Did uh you just interview

Robert:
Ohh unfortunately yes

Merv:
What do you mean

Robert:
That business cant attract anyone Its awful up there Those people seem like theyre in prison waiting out life sentences in a dying industry

Merv:
Place must be horrible I dont know if I want this job gets on elevator

Merv:
in elevator Well if I get this job offer and then I know that Im gonna take it and if I take it I know that Im never gonna quit and then 25 years are gonna go by and Im gonna die here

Dwight:
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview Robert stares at Dwight What are you doing Dwight sits up abruptly Stop trying to figure me out

Robert:
I just did

Dwight:
You cant

Robert:

Dwight:
No its not

Dwight:
Stop trying to figure me out Robert turns to ignore Dwight Do you even know anything about paper How its made

Dwight:

Toby:
Well why would you need relocation if you already live in Scranton

Merv:
Well Id want to move further away you know Just I dont want any chance to run into my coworkers outside the office

Jim:
Can I ask why youre leaving your current job

Merv:
pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware Im leaving my other job because they were all jerks really opens tupperware You know all of em You had your jerkwads and your jerkoffs so just between the wads and the offs I just I had to get outta there begins eating sandwich

Merv:

Gabe:

Gabe:
Well Tobys in charge of Human Resources that would include communication I think that Tobys done a fine job

Toby:
I didnt think you were

Gabe:
I have two relationships with Andy I have a personal relationship and I have a professional relationship Personally yeah I think hes a rat and I think hes responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin Professionally he broke up the happiest couple in this office

The Search Committee finally decided after a lot of deliberation on Robert California for the manager position Who took one look around and left He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO CEO her own job He talked her out of her own job And I dont really know how someone does that But anyway then the position was his to fill And he chose

Andy:
drumroll with hands I its unbelievable True I may have been the second choice but I was the firstchoices first choice And about Dwight I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk And I told him I need a really strong number two I want you to be my enforcer Smart right

Andy:
Oh that it might That might actually be what Im thinking of Can you clarify that

Robert:
Let me tell you some things I find productive Positive reinforcement Negative reinforcement Honesty Ill tell you some things I find unproductive Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues And then inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night No I do not believe in that at all If I invited you to lunch I think youre a winner If I didnt I dont But I just met you all Life is long opinions change Winners prove me right Losers prove me wrong

When youre a kid you picture a pilot kinda like this imitates plane noises while steering wildly But then you learn thats crashing the plane The right way to do it is more like this calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth Or better yet like this takes hands off imaginary wheel Now that Im manager I think about that a lot I let Dwight run the meetings I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way

Andy:
Which combo do you think Roberts gonna like better

Darryl:
No OK I dont wanna be here anymore Fire me

Andy:
So Darryl says to me fire me But what he really means is Im gonna say something really weird try and figure out what it means So I say No youre not fired But what I really mean is I have no idea what your talking about but Im gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling betterI really hope thats what he and I mean

Andy:

Gideon:
FYI Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule

Andy:
Eh cool Well figure that out

Nate:
Also FYI ah I dont techinically have a hearing problem but sometimes when theres a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time Ill hear em as one big jumble Uh again its not that I cant hear uh because thats false I can Um I just cant distinguish between everything Im hearing

Andy:
Got it Dually noted You points to Bruce Coolest tank top I have ever seen Where did you get that

Darryl:
He died

Andy:
He didnt die his brain died And my brain is still very much alive and Id be happy to give you business classes How come you havent asked me about it

Darryl:
I didnt have time because of my daughter

Andy:

Darryl:
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease

Kevin:
OK Darryl listen and then you will understand The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now its cool cause we found another use for them

Jim:
OK alright thatslook All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things

Darryl:

Erin:

Darryl:
Rosebud

Oscar:
Its a reference to Citizen Kane Something that explains why a person became the way they are

Darryl:
I know Citizen Kane Rosebud didnt explain why he was how he was it just represented what was important to him as a child that he missed

Oscar:
Different school of thought Lets just agree to disagree

Ryan:
Yeah Im too hot anyway

Andy:
Whats the story

Oscar:

Stanley:
What the hell is going on here

Andy:
I think weve seen enough  You can turn it off now  everyone murmurs agreement Yeah turn it off now

Stanley:

Oscar:

Andy:
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding

Robert:
Why didnt you simply ask Andy to clarify  Asking is a very easy thing to do  Youre obviously very close Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert  Oh I see  This no longer seems like my business Robert sits

Erin:
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so

Robert:
You were going to talk at the end of the Im not here

Robert:

Meredith:

Robert:
to camera What am I up to

Jim:
Like a few years down the road Cece says Mom theres a ghost in my closet Now you say one of two things  one Youre just having a bad dream or two Lets go see what it was

Pam:
Im not gonna freak her out Jim

Jim:
Ok

Pam:
Im not gonna lie to her either

Jim:
Oh come on

Robert:
When I was a boy there was an empty house just up the hill from my familys It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil One day a young woman Lydia moved into the house with her infant child That very night Lydia was awakened by a loud heinous hissing sound hisses She walked to the nursery and there in babys crib was a snake wrapped around babys neck squeezing tighter and tighter

Creed:
Oh my goodness

Robert:
The crib was full of dirt Baby struggled to free itself from underneath reaching and clawing gasping for air Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi lurching toward baby for they were mummies

Kevin:
Nooo

Robert:
Amongst them was a man tall slim

Meredith:
Jim rolls eyes

Robert:
Almost instinctively she turned to her husband Oh wait she thought I dont have a husband For Lydia and her husband had had an argument one they couldnt get past Each night they slept one inch farther apart until one night Lydia left It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds She had quit the book club the choir citing something about their high expectations Her lips slowly grew together from disuse Everytime she wanted to act and didnt another part of her face hardened until it was stone And that fevered night she rushed to the nursery threw open the door Baby are you okay Baby sat up slowly turned to mother and said Im fine btch Im fine

Bert:
laughs

Robert:
Fear plays an interesting role in our lives How dare we let it motivate us How dare we let it into our decision making into our livelihoods into our relationships Its funny isnt it we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear

Bert:
Toby

Toby:
Oh hey Bert Wanna see the dance Dem bones dem bones dem dry

Dwight:
The accountability booster It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office From a late delivery to an accounting error Five strikes in a day equals a home run One home run and youre out

Dwight:
Roberts favorite songs Creep by TLC Creep by Radio Head You remember that one Jim There is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper Oscar He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him Kelly

Jim:
Wait so you installed a doomsday device

Dwight:
No its an accountability booster

Jim:
Which when it goes off it destroys everything Very similar to a doomsday device

Dwight:
Jim youre trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other I am confident that you guys are equal to the task

Kelly:
Um no were not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives

Dwight:
Everyone angrily disagreeingSmilenod Smile and nod

Andy:
Are you sure this is a good idea I mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes

Dwight:
But the device will change that Without a safety net people will improve

Andy:
Alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work Be extra careful Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha

Stanley:
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me

Oscar:
Theres an easy way to tell if this device is a sham We just make a mistake Ill send an order down to shipping before weve received payment

Dwight:
alert goes off Oh theres one mistake

Erin:
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run

Offscreen:

Oscar:

Toby:
Radiant

Phyllis:
Yeah you have this sexy glow

Gabe:
Its one of the most common fetishes

Pam:
Really well thank you all

Ryan:
Yes Have you seen her in a bikini Amazing

Toby:
You know what would be the hottest thing ever Its a pregnant Helen Mirren

Dwight:
Ok ok ok no no no This is disgusting You realize what youre saying The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman

Oscar:
In this case yes

Dwight:
No There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman

Phyllis:
No were not

Dwight:
Yes you are And another thing Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov Thats right Youre fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian

Darryl:
Nice scatting man

Andy:
Thank you I think I said doop instead of boop at one point

Kevin:
Hey screw you

Andy:
sees Robert California enter Hey Robert are we meeting early

Robert:
Just taking a stroll What exactly have I stumbled upon here

Andy:
Well were all musicians and we play together sometimes

Robert:
Youre a band

Thank you

Kevin:
Were called Kevin and the Zits

Darryl:
That was never agreed upon

Robert:
I miss being in a band

Kevin:
I have a tambourine

Robert:
Tambourine You know Im the CEO right

Andy:
to Kevin CEOs dont play tambourines Tambourines are for girlfriends

Andy:
Great

Kevin:
Nice guys Robert is going to be a Zit

Darryl:
Again never agreed upon

Andy:
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band And when youre in a rock and roll band with somebody youre bonded for life

Darryl:
Usually that life is short and tragic Thats okay right

Andy:
Yeah even cooler

Kevin:
We all got to go sometime

Pam:
Hey

Jim:
Hey

Pam:
Helen Mirren Hot

Jim:
Yeah Super pretty

Pam:
Huh What about Cathy

Pam:
Im not asking if youre in to her Just objectively do you find her attractive

Jim:
And Im telling you I dont

Pam:
You dont find Cathy attractive

Jim:
No I dont

Jim:
No Im not going to tell my ninemonthspregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive Just like Im not going to tell my twoyearold daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun Its true but it doesnt help anybody

Pam:
Look at her Even I want some fries with that shake

Jim:
Okay Uh I dont So are we good Jim leaves

Dwight:
Thats just absurd

Pam:
Yes because shes hot right

Dwight:
Her breasts are large her waist is small her reproductive health in ample evidence And facial symmetry come on

Dwight:
Why would I or anyone else think that youre hot right now I cant impregnate you and thats the driving force between malefemale attraction

Pam:
What about before Was I attractive before

Dwight:
Meh you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight gradual decline and a steep dropoff when you got pregnant for the first time Gradual recovery and uh well now obviously youre at an alltime low

Dwight:
You think Jims lying laughs Thats so cute I know hes lying

Pam:
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it

Dwight:
Done Pam goes for a high five I never touch a pregnant woman

Dwight:
If were going to work together we need some ground rules

Pam:
Okay

Dwight:
Rule one our only loyalty is to the truth

Pam:
I think so Okay

Dwight:
Rule two we stop at nothing

Dwight:
Rule three Dont fall in love

Pam:
Yep good

Dwight:
Were gonna bust this guy

Pam:
Honesty is very important to me

Dwight:
So important And then we will destroy the man himself

Pam:
Lets just see how we feel when we get there

Dwight:
None taken What do you got

Kelly:
It is called the matchmaker test and it is very powerful Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy If Jim picks a really hot friend then we know that he thinks that Cathys hot

Pam:
Hmm

Curtis:

Dwight:

Pam:

Dwight:
Just ugly enough to have deniability

Dwight:
Well Jim may be lying with his words but he cant lie with his body

Pam:
No Kelly dont

Dwight:
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs The puffing of the chest mirroring increased blood flow to the crotch I say we start there

Dwight:
Exactly

Creed:
Howd I get this long triangle

Pam:
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth

Jim:

Pam:
Wait thats it Thats the question youre going to ask him

Dwight:

Old Man:
You have to share the machine with others

Dwight:
mimicking Well thats what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten

Jim:
Okay Dwight come on to old man You can go first

Old Man:
Thank you

Dwight:
Jim are you serious

Andy:
Cause uh my bodys starting to get bruised

Darryl:

Kevin:
Guys this means theyre Kevin and the Zits now

Darryl:
No man we are

Andy:
Well

Dwight:
to old man Okay youre done

Old Man:
I have a new heart you know

Dwight:

Erin:
to Dwight Yeah but Im confused

Erin:
Mmhmm

Dwight:
nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms

Erin:
Oh DPA sounds way more important that total deaths

Dwight:
Oh it is And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home I mean it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush laughs Im telling you theyre heartbreaking too So beautifully written

Oscar:
Dwight what are you telling this girl

Dwight:
The truth

Oscar:
Stop filling her head with nonsense okay She doesnt know any better

Dwight:
No no no Youre filling her head with nonsense You and the history books Im telling the truth

Erin:
Interesting

Dwight:
Yes thank you All of history has been whitewashed

Oscar:
Really Why dont you tell us the real history Gore Vidal

Dwight:
Okay I will I dont know who that is but Im gonna tell you this

Oscar:

Dwight:
Gettysburg was very important Credit where credit is due okay Big mad props to Gettysburg Was it however the most northern battle of the civil war

Oscar:
Yes yes yes

Erin:

Oscar:
Yes

Dwight:
No it was not

Oscar:

Oscar:
Erin

Dwight:

Robert:
I am so eager to hear your gamechangers Lets dig in shall we

Ryan:
Raw fish the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat Now we cant get enough of it From movie stars to construction workers sushi is whats for dinner Let me throw another idea at you Origami What The crazy art of paper folding from thats right Japan Dont you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan We can do that With origami Its the sushi of paper

Robert:
This idea hasnt gripped me What else did you come up with

Robert:
That was bad

Robert:
The situation you described returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine is not one Im familiar with

Stanley:
In the AfricanAmerican community

Robert:
No

Darryl:
Thats fascinating Tell me whats the significance of the peach orchard thought

Park Ranger:
Oh well thats a great question Actually some of the most

Park Ranger:
Sure

Park Ranger:
Uh I havent heard of that one

Dwight:
Really Okay followup question How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut

Oscar:
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding

Andy:
We dont need to bother this poor gentleman I know exactly where were going Giddy up Tallyho

Gabe:
No no Im

Gabe:
Apparently I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums historical monuments elementary schools I dont see itChelseas Mom Chelsea give Mr Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture

Gabe:
Okay Quick

Man:
Hey Lincolns starting light applause

Pam:
Okay You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us and as you know as I tell it I dont like it Unless of course you are responding to it

Robert:
I am not

Pam:
At this point when youre this pregnant its kind of like senior spring The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet

Robert:
Kevin youve been quiet Im curious to know what your gamechanger is

Kevin:
Well you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A1 spot They do that cause they think A1s the best spot for the best cookie But the real best spot is D4 Right Thats where the eyes go So

Robert:
Cookies Cookie placement

Robert:
Who else agrees with Kevin that were wasting facilities manpower on our underselling products when we should be pushing our topperformers everyone raises their hand Robert laughs There you go Consensus

Ryan:
Okay we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around and I am just some goodlooking guy

Gabe:
as Lincoln I just dont understand Its 1865 victory is ours Ive saved the very soul of our nation and yet happiness eludes me Oh perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits

Stanley:
how about that twoholepunch letter Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal

Robert:
Thats the oatmeal cookie Fantastic Kevin Fantastic laughs

Kevin:
Thank you

Jim:
By the way did we leave all the food on the bus

Andy:
Lets talk about food for a second Food for thought

Jim:
Yeah thats what I had for breakfast and I think thats probably why Im still hungry

Erin:
Hunger for chicken chimichangas Right Darryl

Darryl:
Thats good

Andy:
Exactly Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for Pride Now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died He wasnt about to let them have that flag Pride Right guys holds up flag I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin Cost me two hundred dollars

Jim:
Only two hundred dollars

Andy:
We are all branches on this tree And from the tree comes paper Were all part of a business But business is war Whats that I hear Uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag Wha whats going on here Weehoo Come and get it Whos gonna get the flag Whos getting it Whoa Hey Ho Dont look where I am look where Im going Juke right juke left

Darryl:
Andy this is inappropriate People died here man

Andy:
Get the flag Get the flag Come on Big Tuna What you gonna do about it We got a flag right here Weehoo

Andy:
Spangler Springs is a mile this way

Jim:
Oh wow  So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back

Phyllis:
I dont think I should walk anymore  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal yogurt coffee orange juice and toast  Two poached eggs  And then half a sandwich on the bus

Andy:
Alright fine  You know what  I guess this place just hasnt rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would  Im still going  And Im not going to ask anymore  Im not even going to look back  Im just going to assume that youre with me

Robert:
And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared

Kevin:
I dont know

Robert:
Right  I mean youre an accountant  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane

Kevin:
Yes  I am an accountant

Oscar:
Dwight  this is one of the archivists here  I thought maybe we could consult him

Dwight:
Really

Oscar:
Yeah

Dwight:
Well  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms

Dwight:
YES  Ha  Prepare to be refuted  Go on

Archivist:
There you go

Soldier:
Dearest mother Im sorry it has been so long since my last letter  It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive  Melvin Fifer Garris

Dwight:
Hallowed ground

Narrator:
But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all  It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war

Oscar:
Wow  This is so much better than the story you made up

Dwight:
Ive seen enough

Oscar:
Youre right  There should be a monument to this

Kevin:
What No

Ryan:
Its really really good Robert  Let me explain

Robert:
Well what is the idea

Kevin:
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands

Ryan:
You know what  Now I remember  That was your idea patting Kevin on the back That is 100 percent your idea

Andy:
making pencil imprint Dammit

Darryl:
Hey

Andy:
You guys came  Wheres everyone else

Darryl:
Back at the bus  We were locked out  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich

Andy:
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there  I guess he follows orders

Andy:
Even without an audience youre still at it

Jim:
What are you talking about

Andy:
Our office has a disease  And it goes by many names  Sarcasm  Snark  Wisecracks  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes  Thats what you did with this trip

Jim:
Andy  this whole idea of our situation being just like war  Its just not true  We just work at a paper company  And youre our regional manager  And guess what man  You dont have to prove anything  We like you as regional manager  Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head  Im wearing a very pink hat  Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure DM does GB means something kinda sexual  But guess whos wearing them  All of us  Just for you man  Thats huge

Andy:
You dont like the hats

Jim:
Theyre terrible

Darryl:
I hate myself

Andy:
They just didnt turn out how I wanted  In my head they were cooler but they do look weird

Andy:
voiceover the three walking The world will little note nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and thats good because I was basically wrong  I wanted my team to be like this army and I was their general  But I guess its really more like theyre just people who work in an office and Im their manager  Yeah thats really probably a better analogy now that I think about it

Gabe:
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show in Lincoln voice Oh Mary this is wonderful Ok Mary stop your scolding  Ill be quiet aside to the audience I need her like I need a hole in the head scattered chuckles from the crowd Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head BANG  Ooh Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat bows runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink DM does GB hat and runs off

Robert:
Haha There he is You mind lending a hand Im typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board

Kevin:
I can do that

Kevin:
Your arm feels good on my back

Kevin:
For some reason my boss is obsessed with cookies Its not my specialty My specialty is pizza But Im flexible

Andy:
Charge

Kelly:
Isnt Gettysburg like three hours away

Erin:
No Its like two hours and fortysix minutes

Andy:
Its kind of a haul so we should probably get going And tuna I made a special sandwich for you guess which kind

Jim:
Tuna

Andy:
Yes Tuna of the land Turkey With pesto

Andy:
Water

Jim:
Ohho I am in

Jim:

Andy:
Getting everyone on the bus check Giving everyone hats check Sexiest eastern European girls uh check

Darryl:
Hey Devils Den is that way we should check it out Thats where the snipers hid

Andy:
Please Everyone and their mother goes to Devils Den Its the Olive Garden of Gettysburg

Phyllis:
Oh I like Olive Garden

Andy:
Well I meant that in a bad way Obviously it tastes good but its not cool

Jim:
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground

Andy:
That is what Im showing you

Dwight:
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems Doesnt hurt to have a smile on your face either

Oscar:
Guys Over here we found the bus

Phyllis:

Jim:

Phyllis:

Oscar:

Ive been meaning to join a gym narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val For my health I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President I didnt realize how easy that would be So now I want to live long enough to see a really really gay President Or a supermodel President I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents

Dwight:
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources Chairs wear out faster it takes more Freon to keep them cool they flush the toilets more often plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes But a gym turns fat into cash

Andy:
Alright The DM Express is pulling out

Andy:

Dwight:
Darryl picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire

Darryl:

Andy:
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is

Susan:
Uh I could work in customer service HR even

Andy:
Those are fully staffed as well

Robert:
Are you telling me that theres no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands

Andy:
laughing nervously Yes

Robert:

Let me beat around the bush for a second Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about

Susan:
Robert this is very uncomfortable Obviously theres no place for me here So thank you for trying Why dont we just let it go

Robert:
No Absolutely not Andrew there must be something you can do Think

Andy:
Alright Well then welcome aboard

Angela:

Andy:

Oscar:
How mean are we talking about

Andy:
It would be great if she were gone by lunch Erin youre up Find her a place to work but not too comfortable

Dwight:

Andy:
Can I interest you in someone less essential Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps

Dwight:
Oh my god

Andy:
Theyre not expendable exactly I just cantI cant think of the word Im trying to find

Dwight:
Are you kidding me Im supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops Wed never get off the runway

Andy:
Alright look I gotta keep this office functioning somehow So I have put together a list heres your team Darryl and Phyllis you can have but youre also taking Kathy Kelly and Kevin

Andy:

Jim:
Robert Hey Exclamation point

Jim:

Pam:

Bob:

Bob:
Why do you need a pen

Darryl:
Back off I got my reasons

Dwight:
May I have your attention please Could Kathy Darryl Phyllis Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately

Kelly:
Why

Dwight:
Oh no big deal Its just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee Florida

Stanley:
What

Meredith:
Wait Kathy gets to go Uh why does she even still work here Pam is back

Oscar:
It just feels like a slap in the face

Dwight:
I can understand your pain and your rage but you know what Andy is an honorable man let us not question his choices Im sure he had his reasons

Oscar:
Were not questioning his reasons I just wanna know what they are

Dwight:
I know you and me both brother It seemed kinda random to me but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime

Dwight:
Good point But were gonna be working pretty hard until five PM After that its gonna be beach volleyball trips to Cape Canaveral and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan

Ryan:
What are the criteria for going

Dwight:
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness But theres an easy way to find out knocks on Andys office door Oh Andy gotta few questions for you

Dwight:
Uh the Florida picks got out and people were just kind of curious as to why they werent picked and maybe you could just clarify

Andy:
Well uhwell the deliberations were confidential soI feel like we should respect that

Stanley:
Respect it Youre trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson

Kevin:
Hey

Angela:
Ok its obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office

Kelly:
Important Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch

Angela:
My baby is not a monster

Dwight:
Hey Be proud of your enormous monster baby I was once an enormous monster baby

Group:
Stop it

Andy:
Guys

Ryan:
Stop Stop it Andy

Andy:
Dudesthe dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me

Dwight:
OK hey I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered

Andy:
Wha

Stanley:
If anybodys going to Florida it should be me Every shirt I have that isnt a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama Im the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice

Andy:
OK I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida Im happy to hear you out

Dwight:
Great idea So why doesnt everyone just take the next five to six hours come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it

Andy:
No That is a ridiculous waste of time

Andy:
Five to six hours

Dwight:
Three to four hours

Andy:
No no no no

Dwight:
Two to three hours

Andy:
Nope

Dwight:
Come up with a statement in the next hour

Andy:
Thirty minutes

Creed:
Im out

Pam:
Ok read it back to me

Jim:
reading text Robert great offer Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets

Pam:
Good Doesnt sound pushyyoure just stating a fact

Pam:
Well done And we managed to kill the entire morning

Jim:
Really did Text bleep He responded LOL

Phyllis:
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in

Dwight:
I have already picked my team Darryl Oscar Angela Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking Whats that Its not up to me I only have influence Well thats all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving

Andy:

Ryan:
Not both Just one me Or if not me Kelly Ideally me Again youth knowledge Thats what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project teamor Kelly Kapoor Again not both Thanks

Andy:
Very impressive He put a lot of work into that

Dwight:
Mmhm Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world All show no meat

Kevin:
Because I feel like that Im in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again You know just sitting watching enjoying the sport Maybe putting down a few dollars if theres like a crazy mismatch or something

Dwight:
Ok Thank you Kevin well let you know

Andy:
Thank you

Toby:
It is real thank you for saying that

Andy:
Yeah wow Its almost like were not all experiencing the same winter

Andy:
Well

Erin:
I do I really do I think it would be a nice way to clear my head

Dwight:
You know I dont think its a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality

Erin:
Either or But if you can find someone to fill in I would love to go

Andy:
Well it wouldnt be hard to find someone to fill in

Erin:
Really Oh great Good ahem good

Jim:

Jim:
Total nightmare

Pam:
I was going to say good because Ill have all the help I need

Jim:

Pam:
Exactly

Dwight:
I wouldnt say thatits a bit much

Jim:
You know Dwight if you didnt want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation That way I couldnt go

Dwight:
Jim is essential to th

Dwight:
This is stupid Cut

Jim:
Alright Im gonna pack my trunks

Dwight:

Dwight:
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while were at corporate

Jim:
So what is this special project

Dwight:
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace They want to set up their own version of an Apple store

Jim:
That sounds awesome

Dwight:
It did it did

Erin:
Yeah And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you dont have to carry it around like a dope Like a coat check Dwight writes on whiteboard Oh dont write it down unless you like it

Dwight:
Oh I like it

Ryan:
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party So I think our question is How do we make this a better party

Dwight:
No We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that They need to be all business Let all the other stores look like a toy store

Ryan:
Right Think different from Apple

Jim:
Dwight is now a good time to go over what you expect of us

Dwight:
long pause Yes What are my expectations for the group

Dwight:
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley a solid player Ryan who is capable of surprises Erin an excellent follower and Kathy a probably not totally useless enigma And well Jim Under the right manager thats not a bad team Perfectinschlag

Ryan:

And my eye will heal But if the police come then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area

Angela:
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood

Pam:
18505

Darryl:
Guys guys Thats so vague You gotta do the zip plus four 18505 dash 7427

Phyllis:

Creed:

Meredith:

Toby:
That may have been my fault

Meredith:
What the hell Toby

Toby:
I dont think thats very common

Andy:
What if youre being attacked by a 411 man who is penisless

Oscar:
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker

Andy:
Why dont we start with the basics Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby and then like a fifth grade girl and then you know if we have time on up to a scary man

Andy:
So in that scenario what if the victim suckerpunches the attacker in the face What can the attacker then do to better protect himself

Toby:
Its interesting that youre drawn to the point of view of the attacker You would like the turn of the table Okay the latest Chad Flenderman novel everyone groans written from the point of view of his nemesis Dr Lucifer Wu

Angela:
Can I please leave I have a rape flute

Toby:
All right well lets try one simple technique together Okay why doesnt everyone stand Okay so youre being attacked Youve got your hands up Simple palm strike to the chin Up to the chin One two

Everyone:
One two

Ryan:

Ryan:

Toby:
Now if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that youre alive

Phyllis:
If Dwights not coming back does that mean we can open his treasure

Oscar:
You guys weve gone over this there is no treasure Erin retrieves the treasure box and slams it down on Dwights desk

Oscar:
When the team left for Tallahassee Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office Dont touch my treasure Ok you understand Obviously he wants us to obsess about it Theres nothing in there has realization Which is obviously what he would want us to think making it the perfect place to hide a treasure Oh god Im Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride

Andy:
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure everyone disagrees

Oscar:
I am dying to know whats in there

Andy:
to Creed standing in front of the treasure box Now carefully open the box

Creed:
opens box pulls out and displays contents Its a photo of all of us

Dwight:

Ryan:
Im in love with Kelly Kapoor And I dont know how Im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that but I do know that right here right now all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her Again that could change

Dwight:
One of Tobys eyes is getting smaller So theres that Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket So Ill keep you posted on that

Dwight:
Every day I brief Nellie on whats going on in the office Most of its irrelevant But a good informer doesnt judge whats worth passing on

Dwight:
Oh and Andy lost his masculinity so congratulations on that

Nellie:
What do you mean

Dwight:
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night By contrast I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all Wow I knew youd win but you just demolished him Im a little bit jealous actually Reduced him to a mere ant

Nellie:
I just wanted to take the mans job not his manhood

Andy:

A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you Got it

Dwight:
Kind of

Pam:
Nellie why dont you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today And Dwight you show us that youre listening

Pam:
Ten years ago I didnt care if Dwight  got married or died a beetfarming bachelor  But having kids makes you so soft I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh and now Im like that poor gimp is somebodys child

Pam:
You know I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women

Dwight:
Look I have no problem with women Its businesswomen and their their power suits and their shoulder pads Dont lie about your shoulders

Pam:
Dwight listen to me Businesswomen are just normal nice reasonable people Who is a nice reasonable person in your experience

Dwight:
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently

Pam:
Okay so when youre selling to this woman just imagine that shes that nice reasonable barber

Dwight:
Okay I can do that

Pam:
Mmhmm Good Baby steps

Dwight:
Of all of the vermin in Gods great green kingdom lice are the ones I detest the most My first day of school I had lice and no one would play with me For 15 years they called me freak and four eyes and scifi nerd and girl puncher All because I had lice when I was 7

Nellie:
Andy we just wondered if we could have a word

Andy:
Its now or never

Nellie:
Well we just had a quick question about this decision of yours You know to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business In your late 30s With no savings to fall back on And no real connections in that business which can be competitive

Andy:
Yeah sure Whats your question

Kevin:
Our question isit seems dumb

Andy:
Well its better than sticking around here and halfassing it right

Nellie:
Of course But what if you were to stay here you know and fullass it Um really give it a go Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek Hmm

Andy:
Nah I like my plan better

Kevin:
Well Andy your plan sucks okay Nobody is going to hire you ever Youre too charactery to be a lead and youre not fat enough to be a great character actor

Andy:
What

Oscar:
No I dont think that he can make it as an actor But he also cant make it as an employee in an office so why not go nuts with it

Pam:
pause Im sorry Is there a question

Woman 2:
Uh no

Man 2:
Pam what was in that teapot letter

Man 2:
I hear ya What did it say

Moderator:
Were gonna move on Next question please

Man 3:
Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobodys actually filming you anymore

Toby:
Yes

Woman 3:
I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed Was it accurate

Woman 4:
I have a question for Jim and Pam Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how youre soul mates So Pam how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia

Jim:
Um you know what I actually didnt handle that move uh very gracefully From not communicating to being a little selfish

Pam:
Listen um I was scared you know I loved what I had and I didnt want to risk it And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too Which was wrong because hes shown me time and again But when the documentary started airing people on the street told me that I had this fairytale romance But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale But then it got deeper and it got stronger and now its better than a fairy tale Its like a long book that you never want to end  And youre fine with that because you just never ever wanna leave it

Woman 4:
Like Harry Potter

Joan:
I have a question for Erin

Erin:
